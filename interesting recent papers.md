>	"On the one hand, Empirical Risk Minimization allows large neural networks to memorize (instead of generalize from) the training data even in the presence of strong regularization, or in classification problems where the labels are assigned at random. On the other hand, neural networks trained with ERM change their predictions drastically when evaluated on examples just outside the training distribution, also known as adversarial examples. This evidence suggests that ERM is unable to explain or provide generalization on testing distributions that differ only slightly from the training data."  
>	"In Vicinal Risk Minimization, human knowledge is required to describe a vicinity or neighborhood around each example in the training data. Then, additional virtual examples can be drawn from the vicinity distribution of the training examples to enlarge the support of the training distribution. For instance, when performing image classification, it is common to define the vicinity of one image as the set of its horizontal reflections, slight rotations, and mild scalings. mixup extends the training distribution by incorporating the prior knowledge that linear interpolations of feature vectors should lead to linear interpolations of the associated targets."

  `optimization`
>	"Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) is a widely adopted technique that enables faster and more stable training of deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite its pervasiveness, the exact reasons for BatchNorm's effectiveness are still poorly understood. The popular belief is that this effectiveness stems from controlling the change of the layers' input distributions during training to reduce the so-called "internal covariate shift". In this work, we demonstrate that such distributional stability of layer inputs has little to do with the success of BatchNorm. Instead, we uncover a more fundamental impact of BatchNorm on the training process: it makes the optimization landscape significantly smoother. This smoothness induces a more predictive and stable behavior of the gradients, allowing for faster training."

Our results apply to a wide variety of first-order methods, including gradient descent, block coordinate descent, mirror descent and variants thereof.

Thus, neither access to second-order derivative information nor randomness beyond initialization is necessary to provably avoid saddle points."

Adaptive gradient methods are particularly popular for training GANs and Q-learning with function approximation. Both of these applications stand out because they are not solving optimization problems. It is possible that the dynamics of Adam are accidentally well matched to these sorts of optimization-free iterative search procedures. It is also possible that carefully tuned stochastic gradient methods may work as well or better in both of these applications."

>	"In a randomly initialized network, the gradients of deeper layers are increasingly uncorrelated. Shattered gradients play havoc with the optimization methods currently in use and may explain the difficulty in training deep feedforward networks even when effective initialization and batch normalization are employed. Averaging gradients over minibatches becomes analogous to integrating over white noise – there is no clear trend that can be summarized in a single average direction. Shattered gradients can also introduce numerical instabilities, since small differences in the input can lead to large differences in gradients."  
>	"Skip-connections in combination with suitable rescaling reduce shattering. Specifically, we show that the rate at which correlations between gradients decays changes from exponential for feedforward architectures to sublinear for resnets. The analysis uncovers a surprising and unexpected side-effect of batch normalization."

We systematically characterize the fragility of several widely-used feature-importance interpretation methods (saliency maps, relevance propagation, and DeepLIFT) on ImageNet and CIFAR-10. Our experiments show that even small random perturbation can change the feature importance and new systematic perturbations can lead to dramatically different interpretations without changing the label. We extend these results to show that interpretations based on exemplars (e.g. influence functions) are similarly fragile. Our analysis of the geometry of the Hessian matrix gives insight on why fragility could be a fundamental challenge to the current interpretation approaches."

  `natural gradient descent` `approximate inference`
>	"Stochastic variational inference typically imposes restrictive factorization assumptions on the approximate posterior, such as fully independent weights. There have been attempts to fit more expressive approximating distributions which capture correlations such as matrix-variate Gaussians or multiplicative normalizing flows, but fitting such models can be expensive without further approximations."  
>	"We show that natural gradient ascent with adaptive weight noise can be interpreted as fitting a variational posterior to maximize the evidence lower bound. This insight allows us to train full covariance, fully factorized, and matrix variate Gaussian variational posteriors using noisy versions of natural gradient, Adam, and K-FAC, respectively."  
>	"On standard regression benchmarks, our noisy K-FAC algorithm makes better predictions and matches HMC’s predictive variances better than existing methods. Its improved uncertainty estimates lead to more efficient exploration in the settings of active learning and intrinsic motivation for reinforcement learning."  
>	"We introduce and exploit a surprising connection between natural gradient descent and variational inference. In particular, several approximate natural gradient optimizers have been proposed which fit tractable approximations to the Fisher matrix to gradients sampled during training such as Adam and K-FAC. While these procedures were described as natural gradient descent on the weights using an approximate Fisher matrix, we reinterpret these algorithms as natural gradient on a variational posterior using the exact Fisher matrix. Both the weight updates and the Fisher matrix estimation can be seen as natural gradient ascent on a unified evidence lower bound, analogously to how Neal and Hinton interpreted the E and M steps of Expectation-Maximization as coordinate ascent on a single objective. Using this insight, we give an alternative training method for variational Bayesian neural networks. For a factorial Gaussian posterior, it corresponds to a diagonal natural gradient method with weight noise, and matches the performance of Bayes By Backprop, but converges faster. We also present noisy K-FAC, an efficient and GPU-friendly method for fitting a full matrix-variate Gaussian posterior, using a variant of Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature with correlated weight noise."

  `stochastic gradient descent` `approximate inference`
>	"We prove that SGD minimizes an average potential over the posterior distribution of weights along with an entropic regularization term. This potential is however not the original loss function in general. So SGD does perform variational inference, but for a different loss than the one used to compute the gradients. Even more surprisingly, SGD does not even converge in the classical sense: we show that the most likely trajectories of SGD for deep networks do not behave like Brownian motion around critical points. Instead, they resemble closed loops with deterministic components. We prove that such “out-of-equilibrium” behavior is a consequence of the fact that the gradient noise in SGD is highly non-isotropic; the covariance matrix of mini-batch gradients has a rank as small as 1% of its dimension."  
>	"It is widely believed that SGD is an implicit regularizer. This belief stems from its remarkable empirical performance. Our results show that such intuition is very well-placed. Thanks to the special architecture of deep networks where gradient noise is highly non-isotropic, SGD helps itself to a potential Φ with properties that lead to both generalization and acceleration."

#### ["Decomposition of Uncertainty for Active Learning and Reliable Reinforcement Learning in Stochastic Systems"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07283) Depeweg, Hernandez-Lobato, Doshi-Velez, Udluft
  `uncertainty estimation`
>	"We have studied a decomposition of predictive uncertainty into its epistemic and aleatoric components when working with Bayesian neural networks with latent variables. This decomposition naturally arises when applying information-theoretic active learning setting, and it also enabled us to derive a novel risk objective for reliable reinforcement learning by decomposing risk into a model bias and noise. In both of these settings, our approch allows us to efficiently learn in the face of sophisticated stochastic functions."  
>	"We investigate safe RL using a risk-sensitive criterion which focuses only on risk related to model bias, that is, the risk of the policy performing at test time significantly different from at training time. The proposed criterion quantifies the amount of epistemic uncertainty (model bias risk) in the model’s predictive distribution and ignores any risk stemming from the aleatoric uncertainty."  
>	"We can identify two distinct forms of uncertainties in the class of models given by BNNs with latent variables. Aleatoric uncertainty captures noise inherent in the observations. On the other hand, epistemic uncertainty accounts for uncertainty in the model. In particular, epistemic uncertainty arises from our lack of knowledge of the values of the synaptic weights in the network, whereas aleatoric uncertainty originates from our lack of knowledge of the value of the latent variables. In the domain of model-based RL the epistemic uncertainty is the source of model bias. When there is high discrepancy between model and real-world dynamics, policy behavior may deteriorate. In analogy to the principle that ”a chain is only as strong as its weakest link” a drastic error in estimating the ground truth MDP at a single transition stepcan render the complete policy useless."

  `variational inference` `posterior approximation`
>	"Intuitively, the reparameterization trick provides more informative gradients by exposing the dependence of sampled latent variables z on variational parameters φ. In contrast, the REINFORCE gradient estimate only depends on the relationship between the density function log qφ(z|x,φ) and its parameters. Surprisingly, even the reparameterized gradient estimate contains the score function — a special case of the REINFORCE gradient estimator. We show that this term can easily be removed, and that doing so gives even lower-variance gradient estimates in many circumstances. In particular, as the variational posterior approaches the true posterior, this gradient estimator approaches zero variance faster, making stochastic gradient-based optimization converge and "stick" to the true variational parameters."  
>	"We present a novel unbiased estimator for the variational evidence lower bound (ELBO) that has zero variance when the variational approximation is exact.  
>	We provide a simple and general implementation of this trick in terms of a single change to the computation graph operated on by standard automatic differentiation packages.  
>	We generalize our gradient estimator to mixture and importance-weighted lower bounds, and discuss extensions to flow-based approximate posteriors. This change takes a single function call using automatic differentiation packages."  
>	"The gain from using our method grows with the complexity of the approximate posterior, making it complementary to the development of non-Gaussian posterior families."

  `variational inference` `posterior approximation` `OPVI`
>	"Classically, variational inference uses the Kullback-Leibler divergence to define the optimization. Though this divergence has been widely used, the resultant posterior approximation can suffer from undesirable statistical properties. To address this, we reexamine variational inference from its roots as an optimization problem. We use operators, or functions of functions, to design variational objectives. As one example, we design a variational objective with a Langevin-Stein operator. We develop a black box algorithm, operator variational inference (OPVI), for optimizing any operator objective. Importantly, operators enable us to make explicit the statistical and computational tradeoffs for variational inference. We can characterize different properties of variational objectives, such as objectives that admit data subsampling - allowing inference to scale to massive data - as well as objectives that admit variational programs - a rich class of posterior approximations that does not require a tractable density."  
>	"Operator objectives are built from an operator, a family of test functions, and a distance function. We outline the connection between operator objectives and existing divergences such as the KL divergence, and develop a new variational objective using the Langevin-Stein operator. In general, operator objectives produce new ways of posing variational inference. Given an operator objective, we develop a black box algorithm for optimizing it and show which operators allow scalable optimization through data subsampling. Further, unlike the popular evidence lower bound, not all operators explicitly depend on the approximating density. This permits flexible approximating families, called variational programs, where the distributional form is not tractable."

>	"SVGD is a general purpose variational inference algorithm that forms a natural counterpart of gradient descent for optimization. SVGD iteratively transports a set of particles to match with the target distribution, by applying a form of functional gradient descent that minimizes the KL divergence."  
>	"Based on exploiting an interesting connection between Stein discrepancy and KL divergence, we derive a new form of variational inference algorithm that mixes the advantages of variational inference, Monte Carlo, quasi Monte Carlo and gradient descent (for MAP). SVGD provides a new powerful tool for attacking the inference and learning, especially when there is a need for getting diverse outputs to capture the posterior uncertainty in the Bayesian framework."  
>
>	"In the old days we were happy with mean field approximation. Currently we don't. As the model goes more complicated, Bayesian inference needs more accurate yet fast approximations to the exact posterior, and apparently mean-field is not a very good choice. To enhance the power of variational approximations people start to use invertible transformations that warp simple distributions (e.g. factorised Gaussian) to complicated ones that are still differentiable. However it introduces an extra cost: you need to be able to compute the determinant of the Jacobian of that transform in a fast way. Solutions of this include constructing the transform with a sequence of "simple" functions -- simple in the sense that the Jacobian is low-rank or triangular. Authors provide another solution which doesn't need to compute the Jacobian at all."  
>	"Exploits the fact that KL(q||p) = -E[tr{Af(x)}] where Af(x) = f(x)(d log p(x)/dx) + d f(x)/dx for a smooth function f(x) and any continuous density p(x). This is the derivative needed for variational inference, and therefore we can draw samples from an initial distribution q0 and evolve them according to x_t+1 = x_t + A k(x,.) for a kernel k() and after some iterations they'll capture the posterior distribution. It's a similar idea to Normalizing Flows but does not require significant parametric constraints or any inversions."

>	"A Bayesian hypernetwork, h, is a neural network which learns to transform a simple noise distribution, p(ϵ)=N(0,I), to a distribution q(θ) = q(h(ϵ)) over the parameters θ of primary neural network. We train q with variational inference, using an invertible h to enable efficient estimation of the variational lower bound on the posterior p(θ|D) via sampling. In contrast to most methods for Bayesian deep learning, Bayesian hypernets can represent a complex multimodal approximate posterior with correlations between parameters, while enabling cheap i.i.d. sampling of q(θ)."  
>	"The key insight for building such a model is the use of an invertible hypernet, which enables Monte Carlo estimation of the entropy term log q(θ) in the variational inference training objective."  
>	"The number of parameters of a DNN scales approximately quadratically in the number of units per layer, so naively parametrizing a large primary net would require an impractically large hypernet. Efficient parametrization of hypernets, however, can actually compress the total size of a network. Factoring a 100x100 weight matrix, W into as W = E100×7 * H7×100 can be viewed as using a simple hypernet (H) to compress the rows of W into 7-dimensional encodings (E)."  
>	"Bayes by Backprop can be can be viewed as a trivial instance of a Bayesian hypernet, where the hypernetwork only performs an element-wise scale and shift of the noise (yielding a factorial Gaussian distribution), which is equivalent to using a hypernet with 0 coupling layers."  
>	"In order to scale BHNs to large primary networks, we use the weight normalization reparametrization: θ = gu; u = v/||v||. We only output the scaling factors g from the hypernet, and learn a maximum likelihood estimate of v. This allows us to overcome the computational limitations of naively-parametrized BHNs, since computation now scales linearly, instead of quadratically, in the number of primary net units. Using this parametrization restricts the family of approximate posteriors, but still allows for a high degree of multimodality and dependence between the parameters. Since q(θ) is now a degenerate distribution (i.e. it is entirely concentrated in a lower-dimensional manifold), we cannot compute KL(q(θ)||p(θ|D)). Instead, we treat g as a random variable, whose distribution induces a distribution (parametrized by u) over θ, and simply compute KL(q(g)||p(g|D)). Since the scale of u is fixed, the scale of g is intuitively meaningful, and we can easily translate commonly-used spherical prior distributions over θ into the priors over g."

>	"Authors propose and dismiss Bayesian Hypernetworks due to the issues of scaling to large primary networks. They use a hypernet to generate scaling factors, z on the means µ of a factorial Gaussian distribution. Because z can follow a complicated distribution, this forms a highly flexible approximate posterior: q(θ) = ∫q(θ|z)q(z)dz. This approach also requires to introduce an auxiliary inference network to approximate p(z|θ) in order to estimate the entropy term of the variational lower bound, resulting in lower bound on the variational lower bound."

  `variational inference` `posterior approximation` `auxiliary variables` `discrete latent variables`
>	"We propose black-box learning and inference algorithms for undirected models that optimize a variational approximation to the log-likelihood of the model. Central to our approach is an upper bound on the log-partition function parametrized by a function q that we express as a flexible neural network."  
>	"Our approach makes generative models with discrete latent variables both more expressive and easier to train."  
>	"Our approach can also be used to train hybrid directed/undirected models using a unified variational framework. Such hybrid models are similar in spirit to deep belief networks. From a statistical point of view, a latent variable prior makes the model more flexible and allows it to better fit the data distribution. Such models may also learn structured feature representations: previous work has shown that undirected modules may learn classes of digits, while lower, directed layers may learn to represent finer variation. Finally, undirected models like the ones we study are loosely inspired by the brain and have been studied from that perspective. In particular, the undirected prior has been previously interpreted as an associative memory module."  
>	"Our work proposes an alternative to sampling-based learning methods; most variational methods for undirected models center on inference. Our approach scales to small and medium-sized datasets, and is most useful within hybrid directed-undirected generative models. It approaches the speed of the Persistent Contrastive Divergence method and offers additional benefits, such as partition function tracking and accelerated sampling. Most importantly, our algorithms are black-box, and do not require knowing the structure of the model to derive gradient or partition function estimators. We anticipate that our methods will be most useful in automated inference systems such as Edward."  
>	"Our approach offers a number of advantages over previous methods. First, it enables training undirected models in a black-box manner, i.e. we do not need to know the structure of the model to compute gradient estimators (e.g., as in Gibbs sampling); rather, our estimators only require evaluating a model’s unnormalized probability. When optimized jointly over q and p, our bound also offers a way to track the partition function during learning. At inference-time, the learned approximating distribution q may be used to speed-up sampling from the undirected model my initializing an MCMC chain (or it may itself provide samples)."

>	"Implicit reparameterization gradients can be used to train VAEs with Gamma, Beta, and von Mises latent variables, leading to latent spaces with interesting alternative topologies."  
>	"Following Graves, we use implicit differentiation to differentiate the CDF rather than its inverse. While the method of Graves is only practical for distributions with analytically tractable CDFs and has been used solely with mixture distributions, we leverage automatic differentiation to handle distributions with numerically tractable CDFs."  
>	"One common example of implicit differentiation is the inverse function theorem. Suppose that you can easily compute y = f(x), but computing f^-1(y) is expensive/hard. Then, you can take points x, compute y = f(x), and by definition have x = f^-1(y). The inverse function theorem tells you that (f^-1(y))' = 1 / f'(x) . So, you can compute the derivative of the inverse even when you cannot easily compute x = f^-1(y) for any y. Implicit differentiation is an extension of this idea that handles the case when the inverse is taken w.r.t. one argument and differentiation is performed w.r.t. another."

Combinatorial optimization algorithms may enable efficient point estimation, but fully Bayesian inference poses a severe challenge in this high-dimensional, discrete space. To surmount this challenge, we start with the usual step of relaxing a discrete set (here, of permutation matrices) to its convex hull, which here is the Birkhoff polytope: the set of all doublystochastic matrices. We then introduce two novel transformations: first, an invertible and differentiable stick-breaking procedure that maps unconstrained space to the Birkhoff polytope; second, a map that rounds points toward the vertices of the polytope. Both transformations include a temperature parameter that, in the limit, concentrates the densities on permutation matrices."

  `compute and memory`
>	"Until recently, research on artificial neural networks was largely restricted to systems with only two types of variable: neural activities that represent the current or recent input and weights that learn to capture regularities among inputs, outputs and payoffs. There is no good reason for this restriction. Synapses have dynamics at many different time-scales and this suggests that artificial neural networks might benefit from variables that change slower than activities but much faster than the standard weights. These "fast weights" can be used to store temporary memories of the recent past and they provide a neurally plausible way of implementing the type of attention to the past that has recently proved very helpful in sequence-to-sequence models. By using fast weights we can avoid the need to store copies of neural activity patterns."

  `continual learning`
>	"Training an agent to use past memories to adapt to new tasks and environments is important for lifelong learning algorithms. Training such an agent to use its memory efficiently is difficult as the size of its memory grows with each successive interaction. Previous work has not yet addressed this problem, as they either use backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally expensive, or truncated BPTT, which cannot learn long-term dependencies, to train recurrent policies. We propose a reinforcement learning method that addresses the limitations of truncated BPTT by using a learned critic to estimate truncated gradients and by saving and loading hidden states outputted by recurrent neural networks. We present results showing that our algorithm can learn long-term dependencies while avoiding the computational constraints of BPTT. These results suggest that our method can potentially be used to train an agent that stores and effectively learns from past memories."  
>	"While feed-forward, reactive policies can perform complex skills in isolation, the ability to store past events in an internal memory is crucial for a wide range of behaviors. For example, a robot navigating a building might need to incorporate past observations to optimally estimate its location, or remember a command previously issued by a person. Perhaps more importantly, long-term memory can be utilized for lifelong learning, where an agent uses past experiences to quickly modify its behavior in response to changing environments. Such recurrent meta-learning has been demonstrated on a variety of supervised learning tasks, and more recently applied to a variety of reinforcement learning tasks. However, realistic applications of policies with memory may demand particularly long-term memorization. For example, a robot tasked with setting the silverware on the table would need to remember where it last stored it, potentially hours or days ago. This kind of long-term memorization is very difficult with current reinforcement learning methods. Specialized architectures have been developed that improve the capabilities of recurrent networks to store information, but such methods still require back-propagation through time (BPTT) for training, which typically limits how far back the error is propagated to at most the length of the trajectory. Past this size, the gradient is truncated. Truncating the gradient between when the policy must perform a crucial task (such as finding the silverware) and the observation that needs to be memorized to know which action to perform (the last location of the silverware) can make it impossible to successfully perform the task."  
>	"While some tasks may be solved by loading entire episodes into memory and avoiding truncation, a lifelong learning agent has no notion of episodes. Instead, a lifelong learning agent lives out a single episode that continuously grows. Computational constraints, both in terms of memory and practical training times, impose a fundamental limit on the memory capacity of neural network policies. Rather than loading full episodes or truncating gradients, one can instead augment the original MDP with memory states. In addition to regular MDP actions, a policy outputs a vector called memory states, which it receives as input at the next time step. These memory states are equivalent to hidden states in normal recurrent neural network, but by interpreting memory states as just another part of the MDP state, recurrent policies can be trained using standard reinforcement learning methods, including efficient off-policy algorithms that can handle potentially infinite episode lengths. However, the use of memory states forces the learning algorithm to rely on the much less efficient gradient-free RL optimization to learn memorization strategies, rather than the low-variance gradients obtained from back-propagation through time (BPTT). For this reason, even truncated BPTT is usually preferred over the memory states approach when using model-free RL algorithms."  
>	"We propose a hybrid recurrent reinforcement learning algorithm that combines both memory states and BPTT. To obtain a practical algorithm that enables memorization over potentially unbounded episodes, we must use some form of memory states to manage computational constraints. However, we must also use BPTT as much as possible to make it feasible for the learner to acquire appropriate memorization strategies. Our actor-critic algorithm includes memory states and write actions, but performs analytic BPTT within each batch, loading subsequences for each training iteration. This approach allows us to use batches of reasonable size with enough subsequences to decorrelate each batch, while still benefiting from the efficiency of BPTT. Unfortunately, the use of memory states by itself is insufficient to provide for a  Markovian state description, since an untrained policy may not store the right information in the memory. This makes it difficult to use memory states with a critic, which assumes Markovian state. To address this issue, we also propose a method for backpropagating Bellman error gradients, which encourages the policy to take write actions that reduce future Bellman error."

It operates in a life-long manner, i.e., without the need to reset it during training. Our memory module can be easily added to any part of a supervised neural network.

#### ["Dynamic Routing Between Capsules"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829) Sabour, Frosst, Hinton
  `information routing` `CapsNet`
>	"A capsule is a group of neurons whose activity vector represents the instantiation parameters of a specific type of entity such as an object or object part. We use the length of the activity vector to represent the probability that the entity exists and its orientation to represent the instantiation paramters. Active capsules at one level make predictions, via transformation matrices, for the instantiation parameters of higher-level capsules. When multiple predictions agree, a higher level capsule becomes active. We show that a discrimininatively trained, multi-layer capsule system achieves state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and is considerably better than a convolutional net at recognizing highly overlapping digits. To achieve these results we use an iterative routing-by-agreement mechanism: A lower-level capsule prefers to send its output to higher level capsules whose activity vectors have a big scalar product with the prediction coming from the lower-level capsule."  
>	"Dynamic routing can be viewed as a parallel attention mechanism that allows each capsule at one level to attend to some active capsules at the level below and to ignore others. This should allow the model to recognize multiple objects in the image even if objects overlap. The routing-by-agreement should make it possible to use a prior about shape of objects to help segmentation and it should obviate the need to make higher-level segmentation decisions in the domain of pixels."  
>	"For thirty years, the state-of-the-art in speech recognition used hidden Markov models with Gaussian mixtures as output distributions. These models were easy to learn on small computers, but they had a representational limitation that was ultimately fatal: The one-of-n representations they use are exponentially inefficient compared with, say, a recurrent neural network that uses distributed representations. To double the amount of information that an HMM can remember about the string it has generated so far, we need to square the number of hidden nodes. For a recurrent net we only need to double the number of hidden neurons.  
>	Now that convolutional neural networks have become the dominant approach to object recognition, it makes sense to ask whether there are any exponential inefficiencies that may lead to their demise. A good candidate is the difficulty that convolutional nets have in generalizing to novel viewpoints. The ability to deal with translation is built in, but for the other dimensions of an affine transformation we have to chose between replicating feature detectors on a grid that grows exponentially with the number of dimensions, or increasing the size of the labelled training set in a similarly exponential way. Capsules avoid these exponential inefficiencies by converting pixel intensities into vectors of instantiation parameters of recognized fragments and then applying transformation matrices to the fragments to predict the instantiation parameters of larger fragments. Transformation matrices that learn to encode the intrinsic spatial relationship between a part and a whole constitute viewpoint invariant knowledge that automatically generalizes to novel viewpoints.  
>	Capsules make a very strong representational assumption: At each location in the image, there is at most one instance of the type of entity that a capsule represents. This assumption eliminates the binding problem and allows a capsule to use a distributed representation (its activity vector) to encode the instantiation parameters of the entity of that type at a given location. This distributed representation is exponentially more efficient than encoding the instantiation parameters by activating a point on a high-dimensional grid and with the right distributed representation, capsules can then take full advantage of the fact that spatial relationships can be modelled by matrix multiplies.  
>	Capsules use neural activities that vary as viewpoint varies rather than trying to eliminate viewpoint variation from the activities. This gives them an advantage over "normalization" methods like spatial transformer networks: They can deal with multiple different affine transformations of different objects or object parts at the same time.  
>	Research on capsules is now at a similar stage to research on recurrent neural networks for speech recognition at the beginning of this century. There are fundamental representational reasons for believing that it is a better approach but it probably requires a lot more small insights before it can out-perform a highly developed technology. The fact that a simple capsules system already gives unparalleled performance at segmenting overlapping digits is an early indication that capsules are a direction worth exploring."  
>
>	"The core idea of capsules is that low level features predict the existence and pose of higher level features; collisions are non-coincidental. E.g. paw HERE predicts tiger THERE, nose HERE predicts tiger THERE, stripe HERE predicts tiger THERE - paw and nose and stripe predict tiger in the SAME PLACE! That's unlikely to be a coincidence, there's probably a tiger.  
>	The core idea of pooling is that high level features are correlated with the existence of low-level features across sub-regions. E.g. I see a paw and a nose and a stripe - I guess we've got some tigers up in this. Even if the paw predicts a Tiger Rampant and the nose predicts a Tiger Face-On and the stripe predicts a Tiger Sideways. Hence CNN's disastrous vulnerability to adversarial stimuli."  
>
>	"A fully connected layer would route the features based on their agreement with a learned weight vector. This defeats the intent of dynamic routing, the whole purpose of which is to route activations to capsules where they agree with other activations. It does the routing based on a fast iterative process in the forward pass, not a slow learning process like gradient descent."

>	"- requires less training data  
>	- position and pose information are preserved (equivarience)  
>	- promising for image segmentation and object detection  
>	- routing by agreement is great for overlapping objects (explaining away)  
>	- capsule activations nicely map the hierarchy of parts

  `architecture search` `SMASH`
>	"The architecture: at each training step, generate the schematics of a random NN architecture; feed the skeleton into the hypernetwork, which will directly spit out numbers for each neuron (as a convolutional hypernetwork it can handle big and small NNs the same way); with the fleshed out NN, train 1 minibatch on the image classification task as usual, and update its parameters; use that update as the error for the hypernetwork to train it to spit out weights for that skeleton which are slightly closer to what it was after 1 minibatch. After training the hypernetwork many times on many random NN architectures, its generated weights will be close to what training each random NN architecture from scratch would have been. Now you can simply generate lots of random NN architectures, fill them in, run them on a small validation set, and see their final performance without ever actually training them fully (which would be like 10,000x more expensive). So this runs on 1 GPU in a day or two versus papers like Zoph which used 800 GPUs for a few weeks. It’s amazing this works, and like synthetic gradients it troubles me a little because it implies that even complex highly sophisticated NNs are in some sense simple & predictable as their weights/error-gradients can be predicted by other NNs which are as small as linear layers or don’t even see the data, and thus are incredibly wasteful in both training & parameter size, implying a large hardware overhang."

  `learning loss function`
>	"Method evolves a differentiable loss function, such that an agent, which optimizes its policy to minimize this loss, will achieve high rewards. The loss is parametrized via temporal convolutions over the agent’s experience. Because this loss is highly flexible in its ability to take into account the agent’s history, it enables fast task learning and eliminates the need for reward shaping at test time. At test time, the learner optimizes only its learned loss function, and requires no explicit reward signal."  
>	"Method is capable of learning a loss function over thousands of sequential environmental actions. Crucially, this learned loss is both highly adaptive (allowing for quicker learning of new tasks) and highly instructive (sometimes eliminating the need for environmental rewards at test time)."  
>	"Our loss’ instructive nature – which allows it to operate at test time without environmental rewards – is interesting and desirable. This instructive nature can be understood as the loss function’s internalization of the reward structures it has previously encountered under the training task distribution. We see this internalization as a step toward learning intrinsic motivation. A good intrinsically motivated agent would successfully infer useful actions in new situations by using heuristics it developed over its entire lifetime. This ability is likely required to achieve truly intelligent agents."  
>	"In addition to internalizing environment rewards, learned loss could, in principle, have several other positive effects. For example, by examining the agent’s history, the loss could incentivize desirable extended behaviors, such as exploration. Further, the loss could perform a form of system identification, inferring environment parameters and adapting how it guides the agent as a function of these parameters (e.g., by adjusting the effective learning rate of the agent)."

  `learning reward function`
>	"Monte Carlo Tree Search methods have proven powerful in planning for sequential decision-making problems such as Go and video games, but their performance can be poor when the planning depth and sampling trajectories are limited or when the rewards are sparse. We present an adaptation of PGRD (policy-gradient for reward design) for learning a reward-bonus function to improve UCT (a MCTS algorithm). Unlike previous applications of PGRD in which the space of reward-bonus functions was limited to linear functions of hand-coded state-action-features, we use PGRD with a multi-layer convolutional neural network to automatically learn features from raw perception as well as to adapt the non-linear reward-bonus function parameters. We also adopt a variance-reducing gradient method to improve PGRD’s performance. The new method improves UCT’s performance on multiple ATARI games compared to UCT without the reward bonus. Combining PGRD and Deep Learning in this way should make adapting rewards for MCTS algorithms far more widely and practically applicable than before."

At the other extreme, we have methods that merely tune hyperparameters over a set of training tasks. There are many possibilities between these two extremes.

We propose a class of simple and generic meta-learner architectures, based on temporal convolutions, that is domain-agnostic and has no particular strategy or algorithm encoded into it."  
>	"TCML architectures are nothing more than a deep stack of convolutional layers, making them simple, generic, and versatile, and the causal structure allows them to process sequential data in a sophisticated manner. RNNs also have these properties, but traditional architectures can only propagate information through time via their hidden state, and so there are fewer paths for information to flow from past to present. TCMLs do a better job of preserving the temporal structure of the input sequence; the convolutional structure offers more direct, high-bandwidth access to past information, allowing them to perform more sophisticated computation on a fixed temporal segment."  
>	"TCML is closest in spirit to [Santoro et al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06065); however, our experiments indicate that TCML outperforms such traditional RNN architectures. We can view the TCML architecture as a flavor of RNN that can remember information through the activations of the network rather than through an explicit memory module. Because of its convolutional structure, the TCML better preserves the temporal structure of the inputs it receives, at the expense of only being able to remember information for a fixed amount of time. However, by exponentially increasing the dilation factors of the higher convolutional layers, TCML architectures can tractably store information for long periods of time."

#### ["Variational Memory Addressing in Generative Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07116) Bornschein, Mnih, Zoran, Rezende
>	"Attention based memory can be used to augment neural networks to support few-shot learning, rapid adaptability and more generally to support non-parametric extensions. Instead of using the popular differentiable soft-attention mechanism, we propose the use of stochastic hard-attention to retrieve memory content in generative models. This allows us to apply variational inference to memory addressing, which enables us to get significantly more precise memory lookups using target information, especially in models with large memory buffers and with many confounding entries in the memory."  
>	"Aiming to augment generative models with external memory, we interpret the output of a memory module with stochastic addressing as a conditional mixture distribution, where a read operation corresponds to sampling a discrete memory address and retrieving the corresponding content from memory. This perspective allows us to apply variational inference to memory addressing, which enables effective training of the memory module by using the target information to guide memory lookups. Stochastic addressing is particularly well-suited for generative models as it naturally encourages multimodality which is a prominent aspect of most high-dimensional datasets. Treating the chosen address as a latent variable also allows us to quantify the amount of information gained with a memory lookup and measure the contribution of the memory module to the generative process."  
>	"To illustrate the advantages of this approach we incorporate it into a variational autoencoder and apply the resulting model to the task of generative few-shot learning. The intuition behind this architecture is that the memory module can pick a relevant template from memory and the continuous part of the model can concentrate on modeling remaining variations. We demonstrate empirically that our model is able to identify and access the relevant memory contents even with hundreds of unseen Omniglot characters in memory."

  `causal learning`
>	"It has been postulated that a good representation is one that disentangles the underlying explanatory factors of variation. However, it remains an open question what kind of training framework could potentially achieve that. Whereas most previous work focuses on the static setting (e.g. with images), we postulate that some of the causal factors could be discovered if the learner is allowed to interact with its environment. The agent can experiment with different actions and observe their effects. We hypothesize that some of these factors correspond to aspects of the environment which are independently controllable, i.e., that there exists a policy and a learnable feature for each such aspect of the environment, such that this policy can yield changes in that feature with minimal changes to other features that explain the statistical variations in the observed data."  
>	"In interactive environments, the temporal dependency between successive observations creates a new opportunity to notice causal structure in data which may not be apparent using only observational studies. In reinforcement learning, several approaches explore mechanisms that push the internal representations of learned models to be “good” in the sense that they provide better control, and control is a particularly important causal relationship between an agent and elements of its environment."  
>	"We propose and explore a more direct mechanism for representation learning, which explicitly links an agent’s control over its environment with its internal feature representations. Specifically, we hypothesize that some of the factors explaining variations in the data correspond to aspects of the world that can be controlled by the agent. For example, an object that could be pushed around or picked up independently of others is an independently controllable aspect of the environment. Our approach therefore aims to jointly discover a set of features (functions of the environment state) and policies (which change the state) such that each policy controls the associated feature while leaving the other features unchanged as much as possible."  
>	"Assume that there are factors of variation underlying the observations coming from an interactive environment that are independently controllable. That is, a controllable factor of variation is one for which there exists a policy which will modify that factor only, and not the others. For example, the object associated with a set of pixels could be acted on independently from other objects, which would explain variations in its pose and scale when we move it around while leaving the others generally unchanged. The object position in this case is a factor of variation. What poses a challenge for discovering and mapping such factors into computed features is the fact that the factors are not explicitly observed. Our goal is for the agent to autonomously discover such factors – which we call independently controllable features – along with policies that control them. While these may seem like strong assumptions about the nature of the environment, we argue that these assumptions are similar to regularizers, and are meant to make a difficult learning problem (that of learning good representations which disentangle underlying factors) better constrained."

>	"First, we take a learning approach to observational causal inference, and build a classifier that achieves state-of-the-art performance on finding the causal direction between pairs of random variables, when given samples from their joint distribution. Second, we use our causal direction finder to effectively distinguish between features of objects and features of their contexts in collections of static images. Our experiments demonstrate the existence of (1) a relation between the direction of causality and the difference between objects and their contexts, and (2) observable causal signals in collections of static images."  
>	"Causal features are those that cause the presence of the object of interest in the image (that is, those features that cause the object’s class label), while anticausal features are those caused by the presence of the object in the image (that is, those features caused by the class label)."  
>	"Paper aims to verify experimentally that the higher-order statistics of image datasets can inform about causal relations. Authors conjecture that object features and anticausal features are closely related and vice-versa context features and causal features are not necessarily related. Context features give the background while object features are what it would be usually inside bounding boxes in an image dataset."  
>	"Better algorithms for causal direction should, in principle, help learning features that generalize better when the data distribution changes. Causality should help with building more robust features by awareness of the generating process of the data."

The GQN takes as input images of a scene taken from different viewpoints, constructs an internal representation, and uses this representation to predict the appearance of that scene from previously unobserved viewpoints. The GQN demonstrates representation learning without human labels or domain knowledge, paving the way toward machines that autonomously learn to understand the world around them."  
>	"Classical neural approaches to this learning problem - e.g., autoencoding and density models - are required to capture only the distribution of observed images, and there is no explicit mechanism to encourage learning of how different views of the same 3D scene relate to one another. The expectation is that statistical compression principles will be sufficient to enable networks to discover the 3D structure of the environment; however, in practice, they fall short of achieving this kind of meaningful representation and instead focus on regularities of colors and patches in the image space."

If we instead said "purple hippo with wings", they could just as easily create a different internal mental representation, to represent this more specific concept. To assess whether the person has correctly understood the concept, we can ask them to draw a few sketches, to illustrate their thoughts. We call the ability to map text descriptions of concepts to latent representations and then to images (or vice versa) visually grounded semantic imagination. We propose a latent variable model for images and attributes, based on variational auto-encoders, which can perform this task. Our method uses a novel training objective, and a novel product-of-experts inference network, which can handle partially specified (abstract) concepts in a principled and efficient way."

>	"We use a tractable generator architecture for which the log-probability densities can be computed exactly. We train the generator architecture by maximum likelihood and we also train the same generator architecture by GAN. We then compare the properties of the learned generators."  
>	"Generators trained by WGAN produce more globally coherent samples even from a relatively shallow generator."  
>	"Minimization of the approximate Wasserstein distance does not correspond to minimization of the negative log-probability density. The negative log-probability densities became worse than densities from a uniform distribution."  
>	"An approximation of the Wasserstein distance ranked correctly generators trained by maximum likelihood."  
>	"The approximate Wasserstein distance between the training data and the generator distribution became smaller than the distance between the test data and the generator distribution. This overfitting was observed for generators trained by maximum likelihood and also for generators trained by WGAN."  
>	"We inspected the negative log-probability density of samples from generator trained by WGAN. The negative log-probability density can be negative, if the probability density is bigger than 1. In contrast, the NVP generator trained by maximum likelihood assigned on average positive values to its own generated samples. A deep generator trained by WGAN learns a distribution lying on a low dimensional manifold. The generator is then putting the probability mass only to a space with a near-zero volume. We may need a more powerful critic to recognize the excessively correlated pixels. Approximating the likelihood by annealed importance sampling (Wu et al., 2016) would not discover this problem, as their analysis assumes a Gaussian observation model with a fixed variance. The problem is not unique to WGAN. We also obtained near-infinite negative log-probability densities when training GAN to minimize the Jensen-Shannon divergence."  
>	"One of the advantages of real NVPs is that we can infer the original latent z0 for a given generated sample. We know that the distribution of the latent variables is the prior N(0,1), if the given images are from the generator. We are curious to see the distribution of the latent variables, if the given images are from the validation set. We display a 2D histogram of the first 2 latent variables z0[1], z0[2]. The histogram was obtained by inferring the latent variables for all examples from the validation set. When the generator was trained by maximum likelihood, the inferred latent variables had the following means and standard deviations: µ1 = 0.05, µ2 = 0.05, σ1 = 1.06, σ2 = 1.03. In contrast, the generator trained by WGAN had inferred latent variables with significantly larger standard deviations: µ1 = 0.02, µ2 = 1.62, σ1 = 3.95, σ2 = 8.96. When generating the latent variables from the N(0,1) prior, the samples from the generator trained by WGAN would have a different distribution than the validation set."  
>	"Real NVPs are invertible transformations and have perfect reconstructions. We can still visualize reconstructions from a partially resampled latent vector. Gregor et al. (2016) and Dinh et al. (2016) visualized ‘conceptual compression’ by inferring the latent variables and then resampling a part of the latent variables from the normal N(0,1) prior. The subsequent reconstruction should still form a valid image. If the original image was generated by the generator, the partially resampled latent vector would still have the normal N(0,1) distribution. We show the reconstructions if resampling the first half or the second half of the latent vector. The generator trained by maximum likelihood has partial reconstructions similar to generated samples. In comparison, the partial reconstructions from the generator trained by WGAN do not resemble samples from WGAN. This again indicates that the validation examples have a different distribution than WGAN samples."  
>	"We looked at the approximate Wasserstein distance between the validation data and the generator distribution. We will train another critic to assign high values to validation samples and low values to generated samples. This independent critic will be used only for evaluation. The generator will not see the gradients from the independent critic. We display the approximate Wasserstein distance between the validation set and the generator distribution. The first thing to notice is the correct ordering of generators trained by maximum likelihood. The deepest generator has the smallest approximate distance from the validation set, as indicated by the thick solid lines. We also display an approximate distance between the training set and generator distribution, and the approximate distance between the test set and the generator distribution. The approximate distance between the test set and the generator distribution is a little bit smaller than the approximate distance between the validation set and the generator distribution. The approximate distance between the training set and the generator distribution is much smaller. The generators are overfitting the training set."  
>	"Real NVP can be used as an encoder in Adversarial Variational Bayes. We were able to measure the gap between the unbiased KL estimate log q(z|x) - log p(z) and its approximation from GAN. We show that Adversarial Variational Bayes underestimates the KL divergence."

  `evaluation`
>	"We propose a method to optimize the representation and distinguishability of samples from two probability distributions, by maximizing the estimated power of a statistical test based on the maximum mean discrepancy. In context of GANs, the MMD may be used in two roles: first, as a discriminator, either directly on the samples, or on features of the samples. Second, the MMD can be used to evaluate the performance of a generative model, by testing the model’s samples against a reference data set."  
>
>	"If we compare images in pixel space, none of the generated distributions by GANs pass those tests. Basically this method notice that there are artefacts in which the two-sample tests can lock onto to distinguish between real and fake images."  
>	"Authors replicated the experiment with MNIST in Salimans et al. (2016) in which human could not distinguish between fake and real digits and showed that for the MMD test the difference was easy, because of the artifacts and because the GANs were only showing standard digits, but the GAN was not able to generate samples from the tail of the distribution. This experiment shows the risk of using human evaluation of densities estimates, as we focus more on normalcy and under-represent the unexpected. GANs might be only focusing on the modes in the data and ignoring those tails, which might be critical in applications in which the tails carry the information of the extreme events that we might be interested in (e.g. think of weird genetic diseases or extreme weather patterns)."

This result is quite appealing, because there are some statistics in which the GANs samples are distributed like the real samples and those statistics are sufficient for our problem in hand then we might be able to rely on GANs as a simulator. The main questions is for which statistics this happens and how broad they are."

#### ["Autoregressive Quantile Networks for Generative Modeling"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05575) Ostrovski, Dabney, Munos
  `alternative to KL divergence` `AIQN` `PixelIQN` `AIQN-VAE`
>	"Most existing generative models for images belong to one of two classes. The first are likelihood-based models, trained with an element-wise KL reconstruction loss, which, while perceptually meaningless, provides robust optimization properties and high sample diversity. The second are GANs, trained based on a discriminator loss, typically better aligned with a perceptual metric and enabling the generator to produce realistic, globally consistent samples. Their advantages come at the cost of a harder optimization problem, high parameter sensitivity, and most importantly, a tendency to collapse modes of the data distribution."  
>	"AIQNs are a new, fundamentally different, technique for generative modeling. By using a quantile regression loss instead of KL divergence, they combine some of the best properties of the two model classes. By their nature, they preserve modes of the learned distribution, while producing perceptually appealing high-quality samples. The inevitable approximation trade-offs a generative model makes when constrained by capacity or insufficient training can vary significantly depending on the loss used. We argue that the proposed quantile regression loss aligns more effectively with a given metric and therefore makes subjectively more advantageous trade-offs."  
>	"IQN, computationally cheap and technically simple, can be readily applied to existing architectures, PixelCNN and VAE, improving robustness and sampling quality of the underlying model."  
>	"PixelIQN model achieves a performance level comparable to that of the fully trained PixelCNN with only about one third the number of training updates (and about one third of the wall-clock time)."  
>	"PixelIQN, due to the continuous nature of the quantile function, can be used to learn distributions over lower-dimensional, latent spaces, such as those produced by an autoencoder, variational or otherwise. Specifically, we use a standard VAE, but simultaneously train a small AIQN to model the training distribution over latent codes. For sampling, we then generate samples of the latent distribution using AIQN instead of the VAE prior. This approach works well for two reasons. First, even a thoroughly trained VAE does not produce an encoder that fully matches the Gaussian prior. Generaly, the data distribution exists on a non-Gaussian manifold in the latent space, despite the use of variational training. Second, unlike existing methods, AIQN learns to approximate the full continuous-valued distribution without discretizing values or making prior assumptions about the value range or underlying distribution."  
>	"A common perspective in generative modeling is that the choice of model should encode existing metric assumptions about the domain, combined with a generic likelihood-focused loss such as the KL divergence. Under this view, the KL’s general applicability and robust optimization properties make it a natural choice, and most of the methods attempt to, at least indirectly, minimize a version of the KL. On the other hand, as every model inevitably makes trade-offs when constrained by capacity or limited training, it is desirable for its optimization goal to incentivize trade-offs prioritizing approximately correct solutions, when the data space is endowed with a metric supporting a meaningful (albeit potentially subjective) notion of approximation. It has been argued that the KL may not always be appropriate from this perspective, by making sub-optimal trade-offs between likelihood and similarity."  
>	"Many limitations of existing models can be traced back to the use of KL, and the resulting trade-offs in approximate solutions it implies. For instance, its use appears to play a central role in one of the primary failure modes of VAEs, that of blurry samples. Zhao et al. (2017) argue that the Gaussian posterior pθ(x|z) implies an overly simple model, which, when unable to perfectly fit the data, is forced to average (thus creating blur), and is not incentivized by the KL towards an alternative notion of approximate solution. Theis et al. (2015) emphasized that an improvement of log-likelihood does not necessarily translate to higher perceptual quality, and that the KL loss is more likely to produce atypical samples than some other training criteria. We offer an alternative perspective: a good model should encode assumptions about the data distribution, whereas a good loss should encode the notion of similarity, that is, the underlying metric on the data space. From this point of view, the KL corresponds to an actual absence of explicit underlying metric, with complete focus on probability."  
>	"Wasserstein GAN reposes the two-player game as the estimation of the gradient of the 1-Wasserstein distance between the data and generator distributions. It reframes this in terms of the dual form of the 1-Wasserstein, with the critic estimating a function f which maximally separates the two distributions. It still faces limitations when the critic solution is approximate, i.e. when f* is not found before each update. In this case, due to insufficient training of the critic or limitations of the function approximator, the gradient direction produced can be arbitrarily bad. We are left with the question of how to minimize a distribution loss respecting an underlying metric. Recent work in distributional reinforcement learning has proposed the use of quantile regression as a method for minimizing the 1-Wasserstein in the univariate case when approximating using a mixture of Dirac functions."

  `alternative to KL divergence` `unifying GANs and VAEs`
>	"The Optimal Transport cost is a way to measure a distance between probability distributions and provides a much weaker topology than many others, including f-divergences associated with the original GAN algorithms. This is particularly important in applications, where data is usually supported on low dimensional manifolds in the input space X. As a result, stronger notions of distances (such as f-divergences, which capture the density ratio between distributions) often max out, providing no useful gradients for training. In contrast, the Optimal Transport behave nicer and may lead to a more stable training."  
>	"We show that the Optimal Transport problem can be equivalently written in terms of probabilistic encoders, which are constrained to match the posterior and prior distributions over the latent space. When relaxed, this constrained optimization problem leads to a penalized optimal transport (POT) objective, which can be efficiently minimized using stochastic gradient descent by sampling from Px and Pg."  
>	"We show that POT for the 2-Wasserstein distance coincides with the objective heuristically employed in adversarial auto-encoders, which provides the first theoretical justification for AAEs known to the authors."  
>	"We also compare POT to other popular techniques like variational auto-encoders. Our theoretical results include (a) a better understanding of the commonly observed blurriness of images generated by VAEs, and (b) establishing duality between Wasserstein GAN and POT for the 1-Wasserstein distance."  
>	"WGAN and VAE are respectively dual and primal approximations with deep-nets of an optimal transport estimator (minimum Kantorovich distance estimator). The approximation is so crude however that OT theory is probably mostly of cosmetic use."  
>	"The optimal transport metrics Wc, for underlying metric c(x,x0), and in particular the p-Wasserstein distance, when c is an Lp metric, have frequently been proposed as being well-suited replacements to KL. Briefly, the advantages are (1) avoidance of mode collapse (no need to choose between spreading over modes or collapsing to a single mode as in KL), and (2) the ability to trade off errors and incentivize approximations that respect the underlying metric."

The goal of this paper is to marry the best features of both models: the efficient training of WaveNet and the efficient sampling of IAF networks. The bridge between them is a new form of neural network distillation, which we refer to as Probability Density Distillation, where a trained WaveNet model is used as a teacher for training feedforward IAF model with no significant difference in quality."  
>	"WaveNet: efficient training, slow sampling"  
>	"IAF: efficient sampling, slow inference"  
>	"Distribution Distillation combines the advantages of both types of flows. It trains one model, which closely resembles MAF, for density estimation. Its role is just to evaluate probability of a data point, given that data point. Once this model is trained, the authors instantiate a second model parametrised by IAF. Now, we can draw samples from IAF and evaluate their probability under the MAF. This allows us to compute Monte-Carlo approximation of the KL-divergence between the two probability distributions, which we can use as a training objective for IAF. This way, MAF acts as a teacher and IAF as a student. This clever application of both types of flows allowed to improve efficiency of the original WaveNet by the factor of 300."

>	"Generative and discriminative learning are quite different. Discriminative learning has a clear end, while generative modeling is an intermediate step to understand the data or generate hypothesis. The quality of implicit density estimation is hard to evaluate, because we cannot tell how well a data is represented by the model. How can we certainly say that a generative process is generating natural images with the same distribution as we do? In this paper, we noticed that even though GANs might not be able to generate samples from the underlying distribution (or we cannot tell at least), they are capturing some structure of the data in that high dimensional space. It is therefore needed to address how we can leverage those estimates produced by GANs in the same way we are able to use other generative modeling algorithms."

>	"We find that most models can reach similar scores with enough hyperparameter optimization and random restarts. This suggests that improvements can arise from a higher computational budget and tuning more than fundamental algorithmic changes. We did not find evidence that any of the tested algorithms consistently outperforms the original one."  
>	"We have started a discussion on how to neutrally and fairly compare GANs. We focus on two sets of evaluation metrics: (i) The Frechet Inception Distance, and (ii) precision, recall and F1. We provide empirical evidence that FID is a reasonable metric due to its robustness with respect to mode dropping and encoding network choices."  
>	"Two evaluation metrics were proposed to quantitatively assess the performance of GANs. Both assume access to a pre-trained classifier. Inception Score is based on the fact that a good model should generate samples for which, when evaluated by the classifier, the class distribution has low entropy. At the same time, it should produce diverse samples covering all classes. In contrast, Frechet Inception Distance is computed by considering the difference in embedding of true and fake data. Assuming that the coding layer follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution, the distance between the distributions is reduced to the Frechet distance between the corresponding Gaussians."  
>	"FID cannot detect overfitting to the training data set, and an algorithm that just remembers all the training examples would perform very well. Finally, FID can probably be “fooled” by artifacts that are not detected by the embedding network."

#### ["Theoretical Limitations of Encoder-Decoder GAN Architectures"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02651) Arora, Risteski, Zhang
  `GAN theory`
>	"Encoder-decoder GANs architectures (e.g., BiGAN and ALI) seek to add an “inference” mechanism to the GANs setup, consisting of a small encoder deep net that maps data-points to their succinct encodings. The intuition is that being forced to train an encoder alongside the usual generator forces the system to learn meaningful mappings from the code to the data-point and vice-versa, which should improve the learning of the target distribution and ameliorate mode-collapse. It should also yield meaningful codes that are useful as features for downstream tasks. The current paper shows rigorously that even on real-life distributions of images, the encode-decoder GAN training objectives (a) cannot prevent mode collapse; i.e. the objective can be near-optimal even when the generated distribution has low and finite support (b) cannot prevent learning meaningless codes for data – essentially white noise. Thus if encoder-decoder GANs do indeed work then it must be due to reasons as yet not understood, since the training objective can be low even for meaningless solutions."

#### ["Approximation and Convergence Properties of Generative Adversarial Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08991) Liu, Bousquet, Chaudhuri
  `GAN theory`
>	"Two very basic questions on how well GANs can approximate the target distribution µ, even in the presence of a very large number of samples and perfect optimization, remain largely unanswered.  
>	The first relates to the role of the discriminator in the quality of the approximation. In practice, the discriminator is usually restricted to belong to some family, and it is not understood in what sense this restriction affects the distribution output by the generator.  
>	The second question relates to convergence; different variants of GANs have been proposed that involve different objective functions (to be optimized by the generator and the discriminator). However, it is not understood under what conditions minimizing the objective function leads to a good approximation of the target distribution. More precisely, does a sequence of distributions output by the generator that converges to the global minimum under the objective function always converge to the target distribution µ under some standard notion of distributional convergence?"  
>	"We first characterize a very general class of objective functions that we call adversarial divergences, and we show that they capture the objective functions used by a variety of existing procedures that include the original GAN, f-GAN, MMD-GAN, WGAN, improved WGAN, as well as a class of entropic regularized optimal transport problems. We then define the class of strict adversarial divergences – a subclass of adversarial divergences where the minimizer of the objective function is uniquely the target distribution."  
>	"We show that if the objective function is an adversarial divergence that obeys certain conditions, then using a restricted class of discriminators has the effect of matching generalized moments. A concrete consequence of this result is that in linear f-GANs, where the discriminator family is the set of all affine functions over a vector ψ of features maps, and the objective function is an f-GAN, the optimal distribution ν output by the GAN will satisfy Ex\~µ[ψ(x)] = Ex\~ν[ψ(x)] regardless of the specific f-divergence chosen in the objective function. Furthermore, we show that a neural network GAN is just a supremum of linear GANs, therefore has the same moment-matching effect."  
>	"We show that convergence in an adversarial divergence implies some standard notion of topological convergence. Particularly, we show that provided an objective function is a strict adversarial divergence, convergence to µ in the objective function implies weak convergence of the output distribution to µ. An additional consequence of this result is the observation that as the Wasserstein distance metrizes weak convergence of probability distributions, Wasserstein-GANs have the weakest objective functions in the class of strict adversarial divergences."  
>
>	"Authors worry about two important aspects of GAN convergence: what how good the generative distribution approximates the real distribution; and, when does this convergence takes place. For the first question the answer is the discriminator forces some kind of moment matching between the real and fake distributions. In order to get full representation of the density we will need that the discriminator grows with the data. For the second question, they show a week convergence result. This result is somewhat complementary to Arora et al. (2017), because it indicates that the discriminator complexity needs to grow indefinitely to achieve convergence. The question that remains to be answer is the rate of convergence, as the moments need to be matched for complicated distributions might require large data and complex discriminators. So in practice, we cannot tell if the generated distribution is close enough to the distribution we are interested in."  
>	"Today’s GAN’s results can be explained in the light of these theoretical results. First, we are clearly matching some moments that relate to visual quality of natural images with finite size deep neural networks, but they might not be deep enough to capture all relevant moments and hence they will not be able to match the distribution in these images."  

#### ["Do GANs Actually Learn the Distribution? An Empirical Study"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08224) Arora, Zhang
  `GAN theory`
>	"On the positive side, we can show the existence of an equilibrium where generator succeeds in fooling the discriminator. On the  negative side, we show that in this equilibrium, generator produces a distribution of fairly low support."  
>	"A recent analysis raised doubts whether GANs actually learn the target distribution when discriminator has finite size. It showed that the training objective can approach its optimum value even if the generated distribution has very low support ---in other words, the training objective is unable to prevent mode collapse. The current note reports experiments suggesting that such problems are not merely theoretical. It presents empirical evidence that well-known GANs approaches do learn distributions of fairly low support, and thus presumably are not learning the target distribution. The main technical contribution is a new proposed test, based upon the famous birthday paradox, for estimating the support size of the generated distribution."

Thus, we do not aim at improving the original GAN or any other generative algorithm. We rather propose and analyse a meta-algorithm that can be used on top of any of them. This meta-algorithm is similar in spirit to AdaBoost in the sense that each iteration corresponds to learning a “weak” generative model (e.g., GAN) with respect to a re-weighted data distribution. The weights change over time to focus on the “hard” examples, i.e. those that the mixture has not been able to properly generate so far."

However, it is indeed unknown how to design a generative network that induces a density dQ that would guarantee βdQ ≤ dPd with a non-zero β when dPd is a high-dimensional structure generative process."

#### ["Tighter Variational Bounds are Not Necessarily Better"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04537) Rainforth, Kosiorek, Le, Maddison, Igl, Wood, Teh
>	"We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that using tighter evidence lower bounds can be detrimental to the process of learning an inference network by reducing the signal-to-noise ratio of the gradient estimator. Our results call into question common implicit assumptions that tighter ELBOs are better variational objectives for simultaneous model learning and inference amortization schemes."

#### ["Inference Suboptimality in Variational Autoencoders"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03558) Cremer, Li, Duvenaud
>	"The quality of posterior inference is largely determined by two factors: a) the ability of the variational distribution to model the true posterior and b) the capacity of the recognition network to generalize inference over all datapoints. We find that suboptimal inference is often due to amortizing inference rather than the limited complexity of the approximating distribution. We show that this is due partly to the generator learning to accommodate the choice of approximation. Furthermore, we show that the parameters used to increase the expressiveness of the approximation play a role in generalizing inference rather than simply improving the complexity of the approximation."  

#### ["Fixing a Broken ELBO"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00464) Alemi, Poole, Fischer, Dillon, Saurous, Murphy
>	"Fitting deep directed latent-variable models by maximizing the marginal likelihood or evidence is typically intractable, thus a common approximation is to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) instead. However, maximum likelihood training (whether exact or approximate) does not necessarily result in a good latent representation, as we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically. In particular, we derive variational lower and upper bounds on the mutual information between the input and the latent variable, and use these bounds to derive a rate-distortion curve that characterizes the tradeoff between compression and reconstruction accuracy. Using this framework, we demonstrate that there is a family of models with identical ELBO, but different quantitative and qualitative characteristics. Our framework also suggests a simple new method to ensure that latent variable models with powerful stochastic decoders do not ignore their latent code."  
>	"We have motivated the β-VAE objective on information theoretic grounds, and demonstrated that comparing model architectures in terms of the rate-distortion plot offers a much better look at their performance and tradeoffs than simply comparing their marginal log likelihoods."

  `WAE`
>	"WAE minimizes a penalized form of the Wasserstein distance between the model distribution and the target distribution, which leads to a different regularizer than the one used by VAE."  
>	"Both VAE and WAE minimize two terms: the reconstruction cost and the regularizer penalizing discrepancy between Pz and distribution induced by the encoder Q. VAE forces Q(Z|X=x) to match Pz for all the different input examples x drawn from Px. Every single red ball is forced to match Pz depicted as the white shape. Red balls start intersecting, which leads to problems with reconstruction. In contrast, WAE forces the continuous mixture Qz:=∫Q(z|x)dPx to match Pz. As a result latent codes of different examples get a chance to stay far away from each other, promoting a better reconstruction."  
>	"WAE shares many of the properties of VAEs (stable training, encoder-decoder architecture, nice latent manifold structure) while generating samples of better quality, as measured by the FID score."

#### ["Neural Discrete Representation Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937) Oord, Vinyals, Kavukcuoglu
  `VQ-VAE`
>	"Language is inherently discrete, similarly speech is typically represented as a sequence of symbols. Images can often be described concisely by language. Furthermore, discrete representations are a natural fit for complex reasoning, planning and predictive learning."  
>	"We introduce a new family of generative models succesfully combining the VAE framework with discrete latent representations through a novel parameterisation of the posterior distribution of (discrete) latents given an observation. Our model, which relies on vector quantization, is simple to train, does not suffer from large variance, and avoids the “posterior collapse” issue which has been problematic with many VAE models that have a powerful decoder, often caused by latents being ignored. Additionally, it is the first discrete latent VAE model that get similar performance as its continuous counterparts, while offering the flexibility of discrete distributions."  
>	"Since VQ-VAE can make effective use of the latent space, it can successfully model important features that usually span many dimensions in data space (for example objects span many pixels in images, phonemes in speech, the message in a text fragment, etc.) as opposed to focusing or spending capacity on noise and imperceptible details which are often local."  
>	"When paired with a powerful prior, our samples are coherent and high quality on a wide variety of applications such as speech and video generation. We use a PixelCNN over the discrete latents for images, and a WaveNet for raw audio. Training the prior and the VQ-VAE jointly, which could strengthen our results, is left as future research."  
>	"The discrete latent space captures the important aspects of the audio, such as the content of the speech, in a very compressed symbolic representation. Because of this we can now train another WaveNet on top of these latents which can focus on modeling the long-range temporal dependencies without having to spend too much capacity on imperceptible details. With enough data one could even learn a language model directly from raw audio."  
>	"When we condition the decoder in the VQ-VAE on the speaker-id, we can extract latent codes from a speech fragment and reconstruct with a different speaker-id. The VQ-VAE never saw any aligned data during training and was always optimizing the reconstruction of the orginal waveform. These experiments suggest that the encoder has factored out speaker-specific information in the encoded representations, as they have same meaning across different voice characteristics. This behaviour arises naturally because the decoder gets the speaker-id for free so the limited bandwith of latent codes gets used for other speaker-independent, phonetic information. In the paper we show that the latent codes discovered by the VQ-VAE are actually very closely related to the human-designed alphabet of phonemes."

>	"Generative modeling of discrete data such as arithmetic expressions and molecular structures poses significant challenges. State-of-the-art methods often produce outputs that are not valid. We make the key observation that frequently, discrete data can be represented as a parse tree from a context-free grammar. We propose a variational autoencoder which encodes and decodes directly to and from these parse trees, ensuring the generated outputs are always valid. Surprisingly, we show that not only does our model more often generate valid outputs, it also learns a more coherent latent space in which nearby points decode to similar discrete outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned models by showing their improved performance in Bayesian optimization for symbolic regression and molecular synthesis."

Crucially, the time complexity of the network is c(|S| + |T|), which is cheaper than that of the common seq2seq attention architecture (|S|*|T|). Through dilated convolutions the network has constant path lengths between [source input -> target output] and [target inputs -> target output] nodes.

D, in turn, is trained to tell apart the hidden states of G at training and inference time. At the Nash equilibrium, D cannot tell apart the state spaces any better and G cannot make them any more similar.

#### ["RUDDER: Return Decomposition for Delayed Rewards"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07857) Arjona-Medina, Gillhofer, Widrich, Unterthiner, Hochreiter
>	"We propose a novel reinforcement learning approach for finite Markov decision processes with delayed rewards. In this work, biases of temporal difference estimates are proved to be corrected only exponentially slowly in the number of delay steps. Furthermore, variances of Monte Carlo estimates are proved to increase the variance of other estimates, the number of which can exponentially grow in the number of delay steps. We introduce RUDDER, a return decomposition method, which creates a new MDP with same optimal policies as the original MDP but with redistributed rewards that have largely reduced delays. If the return decomposition is optimal, then the new MDP does not have delayed rewards and TD estimates are unbiased. In this case, the rewards track Q-values so that the future expected reward is always zero. We experimentally confirm our theoretical results on bias and variance of TD and MC estimates. On artificial tasks with different lengths of reward delays, we show that RUDDER is exponentially faster than TD, MC, and MC Tree Search. RUDDER outperforms Rainbow, A3C, DDQN, Distributional DQN, Dueling DDQN, Noisy DQN, and Prioritized DDQN on the delayed reward Atari game Venture in only a fraction of the learning time."  
>	"At its core RUDDER transforms the MDP in a new one which is not delayed and retains all optimal policies. In this new MDP all Q-values are identical to the immediate reward r(s,a) and TD methods are unbiased."  
>	"We show the bias correction for TD Methods takes exponentially long if reward is delayed. We also show that there may be exponentially many states affected from Q-value variances when MC methods are applied."  
>	"Math aside, the big idea of RUDDER is the following: we use an LSTM to predict the return of an episode. To do this, the LSTM will have to recognize what actually causes the reward (e.g. shooting the gun in the right direction causes the reward, even if we get the reward only once the bullet hits the enemy after travelling along the screen). We then use a salience method (e.g. layer-wise relevance propagation or integrated gradients) to get that information out of the LSTM, and redistribute the reward accordingly (i.e., we then give reward already once the gun is shot in the right direction). Once the reward is redistributed this way, solving/learning the actual reinforcement learning problem is much, much easier and as we prove in the paper, the optimal policy does not change with this redistribution."

#### ["Simple Random Search Provides a Competitive Approach to Reinforcement Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07055) Mania, Guy, Recht
>	"We attempted to find the simplest algorithm for model-free RL that performs well on the continuous control benchmarks used in the RL literature. We demonstrated that with a few algorithmic augmentations, basic random search could be used to train linear policies that achieve state-of-theart sample efficiency on the MuJoCo locomotion tasks. We showed that linear policies match the performance of complex neural network policies and can be found through a simple algorithm."  
>	"For application to continuous control, we augment the basic random search method with three simple features. First, we scale each update step by the standard deviation of the rewards collected for computing that update step. Second, we normalize the system’s states by online estimates of their mean and standard deviation. Third, we discard from the computation of the update steps the directions that yield the least improvement of the reward."  
>	"Since the algorithm and policies are simple, we were able to perform extensive sensitivity studies, and observed that our method can find good solutions to highly nonconvex problems a large fraction of the time. Our results emphasize the high variance intrinsic to the training of policies for MuJoCo RL tasks. Therefore, it is not clear what is gained by evaluating RL algorithms on only a small numbers of random seeds, as is common in the RL literature. Evaluation on small numbers of random seeds does not capture performance adequately due to high variance."  
>	"Though many RL researchers are concerned about minimizing sample complexity, it does not make sense to optimize the running time of an algorithm on a single instance. The running time of an algorithm is only a meaningful notion if either (a) evaluated on a family of instances, or (b) when clearly restricting the class of algorithms. Common RL practice, however, does not follow either (a) or (b). Instead researchers run algorithm A on task T with a given hyperparameter configuration, and plot a “learning curve” showing the algorithm reaches a target reward after collecting X samples. Then the “sample complexity” of the method is reported as the number of samples required to reach a target reward threshold, with the given hyperparameter configuration. However, any number of hyperparameter configurations can be tried. Any number of algorithmic enhancements can be added or discarded and then tested in simulation. For a fair measurement of sample complexity, should we not count the number of rollouts used for every tested hyperparameters?"

  `Q-learning`
>	"The theoretical question of "whether model-free algorithms can be made sample efficient" is one of the most fundamental questions in RL, and remains unsolved even in the basic scenario with finitely many states and actions."  
>	"We prove that, in an episodic MDP setting, Q-learning with UCB exploration achieves regret O(sqrt(H^3SAT)), where S and A are the numbers of states and actions, H is the number of steps per episode, and T is the total number of steps. This sample efficiency matches the optimal regret that can be achieved by any model-based approach, up to a single √H factor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis in the model-free setting that establishes √T regret without requiring access to a "simulator."  

#### ["Is the Bellman Residual a Bad Proxy?"](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01629739/document) Geist, Piot, Pietquin
  `Q-learning`
>	"This paper aims at theoretically and empirically comparing two standard optimization criteria for Reinforcement Learning: 1) maximization of the mean value and 2) minimization of the Bellman residual. For that purpose, we place ourselves in the framework of policy search algorithms, that are usually designed to maximize the mean value, and derive a method that minimizes the residual ||T∗ vπ − vπ||1,ν over policies. A theoretical analysis shows how good this proxy is to policy optimization, and notably that it is better than its value-based counterpart. We also propose experiments on randomly generated generic Markov decision processes, specifically designed for studying the influence of the involved concentrability coefficient. They show that the Bellman residual is generally a bad proxy to policy optimization and that directly maximizing the mean value is more likely to result in efficient and robust reinforcement learning algorithms, despite the current lack of deep theoretical analysis. This might seem obvious, as directly addressing the problem of interest is usually better, but given the prevalence of (projected) Bellman residual minimization in value-based reinforcement learning, we believe that this question is worth to be considered."  
>	"Bellman residuals are prevalent in Approximate Dynamic Programming. Notably, value iteration minimizes such a residual using a fixed-point approach and policy iteration minimizes it with a Newton descent. On another hand, maximizing the mean value is prevalent in policy search approaches."  
>	"As Bellman residual minimization methods are naturally value-based and mean value maximization approaches policy-based, we introduced a policy-based residual minimization algorithm in order to study both optimization problems together. For the introduced residual method, we proved a proxy bound, better than value-based residual minimization. The different nature of the bounds made the comparison difficult, but both involve the same concentrability coefficient, a term often underestimated in RL bounds. Therefore, we compared both approaches empirically on a set of randomly generated Garnets, the study being designed to quantify the influence of this concentrability coefficient. From these experiments, it appears that the Bellman residual is a good proxy for the error (the distance to the optimal value function) only if, luckily, the concentrability coefficient is small for the considered MDP and the distribution of interest, or one can afford a change of measure for the optimization problem, such that the sampling distribution is close to the ideal one."

>	"Policy gradient methods have had great success in solving continuous control tasks, yet the stochastic nature of such problems makes deterministic value estimation difficult. We propose an approach which instead estimates a distribution by fitting the value function with a Bayesian Neural Network. We optimize an α-divergence objective with Bayesian dropout approximation to learn and estimate this distribution. We show that using the Monte Carlo posterior mean of the Bayesian value function distribution, rather than a deterministic network, improves stability and performance of policy gradient methods (TRPO, PPO and DDPG) in continuous control MuJoCo simulations."  
>	"We build off of work in Bayesian Neural Networks and distributional perspectives in uncertain value functions to demonstrate an extension which can successfully be leveraged in continuous control domains with dropout uncertainty estimates."  
>	"We find large improvements in Proximal Policy Optimization from using the posterior mean. We suspect that these improvements are partially due to the added exploration, aiding the on-policy and adaptive nature of PPO, during early stages of learning where the uncertainty distribution is large. This is backed by ablation analysis where we find that PPO in the Half-Cheetah environment sees larger improvements from a higher dropout rate (presumably yielding slightly more exploratory value estimates)."  
>	"We found that the Q-value estimates in DDPG were much lower than in the baseline version. We believe this is due to a variance reduction property as in Double-DQN. While in Double-DQN, two function approximators are used for the Q-value function, using dropout effectively creates a parallel to Double-DQN where many different approximators are used from the same set of network weights."

  `QR-DQN` `Q-learning`
>	"One of the theoretical contributions of the C51 work was a proof that the distributional Bellman operator is a contraction in a maximal form of the Wasserstein metric between probability distributions. In this context, the Wasserstein metric is particularly interesting because it does not suffer from disjoint-support issues which arise when performing Bellman updates. Unfortunately, this result does not directly lead to a practical algorithm: the Wasserstein metric, viewed as a loss, cannot generally be minimized using stochastic gradient methods. This negative result left open the question as to whether it is possible to devise an online distributional reinforcement learning algorithm which takes advantage of the contraction result. Instead, the C51 algorithm first performs a heuristic projection step, followed by the minimization of a KL divergence between projected Bellman update and prediction. The work therefore leaves a theory-practice gap in our understanding of distributional reinforcement learning, which makes it difficult to explain the good performance of C51. Thus, the existence of a distributional algorithm that operates end-to-end on the Wasserstein metric remains an open question."  
>	"In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively. By appealing to the theory of quantile regression, we show that there exists an algorithm, applicable in a stochastic approximation setting, which can perform distributional reinforcement learning over the Wasserstein metric. Our method relies on the following techniques:  
>	- We “transpose” the parametrization from C51: whereas the former uses N fixed locations for its approximation distribution and adjusts their probabilities, we assign fixed, uniform probabilities to N adjustable locations  
>	- We show that quantile regression may be used to stochastically adjust the distributions’ locations so as to minimize the Wasserstein distance to a target distribution  
>	- We formally prove contraction mapping results for our overall algorithm, and use these results to conclude that our method performs distributional RL end-to-end under the Wasserstein metric, as desired"  
>	"Authors proposed the use of quantile regression as a method for minimizing the 1-Wasserstein in the univariate case when approximating using a mixture of Dirac functions."  
>	"The quantile regression loss for a quantile at τ∈ [0,1] and error u (positive for underestimation and negative for overestimation) is given by ρτ(u) = (τ − I{u ≤ 0})u. It is an asymmetric loss function penalizing underestimation by weight τ and overestimation by weight 1 − τ. For a given scalar distribution Z with c.d.f. Fz and a quantile τ, the inverse c.d.f. q = Fz−1(τ) minimizes the expected quantile regression loss E z∼ Z [ρτ(z − q)]. Using this loss allows one to train a neural network to approximate a scalar distribution represented by its inverse c.d.f. For this, the network can output a fixed grid of quantiles, with the respective quantile regression losses being applied to each output independently. A more effective approach is to provide the desired quantile τ as an additional input to the network, and train it to output the corresponding value of Fz−1(τ)."

  `SDQN` `Q-learning`
>	"We draw inspiration from the recent success of sequence-to-sequence models for structured prediction problems to develop policies over discretized spaces. Central to this method is the realization that complex functions over high dimensional spaces can be modeled by neural networks that use next step prediction. Specifically, we show how Q-values and policies over continuous spaces can be modeled using a next step prediction model over discretized dimensions. With this parameterization, it is possible to both leverage the compositional structure of action spaces during learning, as well as compute maxima over action spaces (approximately). On a simple example task we demonstrate empirically that our method can perform global search, which effectively gets around the local optimization issues that plague DDPG and NAF. We apply the technique to off-policy (Q-learning) methods and show that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art for off-policy methods on several continuous control tasks."

>	"Neural networks are most effective for value function approximation when the desired target function is smooth. However, value functions are, by their very nature, discontinuous functions with sharp variations over time. We introduce a representation of value that matches the natural temporal structure of value functions."  
>	"A value function represents the expected sum of future discounted rewards. If non-zero rewards occur infrequently but reliably, then an accurate prediction of the cumulative discounted reward rises as such rewarding moments approach and drops immediately after. This is a pervasive scenario because many domains associate positive or negative reinforcements to salient events (like picking up an object, hitting a wall, or reaching a goal position). The problem is that the agent’s observations tend to be smooth in time, so learning an accurate value estimate near those sharp drops puts strain on the function approximator - especially when employing differentiable function approximators such as neural networks that naturally make smooth maps from observations to outputs."  
>	"We incorporate the temporal structure of cumulative discounted rewards into the value function itself. The main idea is that, by default, the value function can respect the reward sequence. If no reward is observed, then the next value smoothly matches the previous value, but becomes a little larger due to the discount. If a reward is observed, it should be subtracted out from the previous value: in other words a reward that was expected has now been consumed. The natural value approximator combines the previous value with the observed rewards and discounts, which makes this sequence of values easy to represent by a smooth function approximator such as a neural network."

>	"Currently, there are a multitude of algorithms that can be used to perform TD control, including Sarsa, Q-learning, and Expected Sarsa. These methods are often studied in the one-step case, but they can be extended across multiple time steps to achieve better performance. Each of these algorithms is seemingly distinct, and no one dominates the others for all problems. In this paper, we study a new multi-step action-value algorithm called Q(σ) which unifies and generalizes these existing algorithms, while subsuming them as special cases. A new parameter, σ, is introduced to allow the degree of sampling performed by the algorithm at each step during its backup to be continuously varied, with Sarsa existing at one extreme (full sampling), and Expected Sarsa existing at the other (pure expectation)."  
>	"With a constant value of sampling parameter σ, Q(σ) is a weighted average between tree backups and regular SARSA: σ varies the breadth of the tree backup, contrasted with TD(λ) where λ varies the depth. Q(σ) allows for interpolation in bias-variance tradeoff: if σ is dynamically adjusted, can enforce a desirable tradeoff."

We addressed these issues by formulating gradient-based versions of these algorithms which minimize the mean-square projected Bellman error. Using a saddle-point formulation, we were also able to provide convergence guarantees and characterize the convergence rate of our algorithms."  
>	"The design and analysis of off-policy algorithms using all the features of reinforcement learning, e.g. bootstrapping, multi-step updates (eligibility traces), and function approximation has been explored extensively over three decades. While off-policy learning and function approximation have been understood in isolation, their combination with multi-steps bootstrapping produces a so-called deadly triad, i.e., many algorithms in this category are unstable. A convergent approach to this triad is provided by importance sampling, which bends the behavior policy distribution onto the target one. However, as the length of the trajectories increases, the variance of importance sampling corrections tends to become very large. An alternative approach which was developed for tabular representations of the value function is the tree backup algorithm which, remarkably, does not rely on importance sampling directly. Tree Backup has recently been revisited by authors of Retrace(λ) algorithm. Both Tree Backup and Retrace(λ) were only shown to converge with a tabular value function representation, and whether they would also converge with function approximation was an open question, which we tackle in this paper."

We prove that such approximate corrections are sufficient for off-policy convergence both in policy evaluation and control, provided certain conditions. These conditions relate the distance between the target and behavior policies, the eligibility trace parameter and the discount factor, and formalize an underlying tradeoff in off-policy TD(λ)."

The two extremes of this tradeoff are one-step Q-learning, and on-policy learning. Formalizing the continuum of the tradeoff is one of the main insights of this paper."

The bias results from selecting, among several noisy estimates, the apparent optimum, which may actually be suboptimal. We propose G-learning, a new off-policy learning algorithm that regularizes the value estimates by penalizing deterministic policies in the beginning of the learning process. We show that this method reduces the bias of the value-function estimation, leading to faster convergence to the optimal value and the optimal policy. The stochastic nature of G-learning also makes it avoid some exploration costs, a property usually attributed only to on-policy algorithms."

As such, this method can be viewed both as a deterministic actor-critic algorithm and an approximate Q-learning algorithm. Unfortunately, the interplay between the deterministic actor network and the Q-function typically makes DDPG extremely difficult to stabilize and brittle to hyperparameter settings. As a consequence, it is difficult to extend DDPG to very complex, high-dimensional tasks, and on-policy policy gradient methods still tend to produce the best results in such settings. Our method instead combines off-policy actor-critic training with a stochastic actor, and further aims to maximize the entropy of this actor with an entropy maximization objective. We find that this actually results in a substantially more stable and scalable algorithm that, in practice, exceeds both the efficiency and final performance of DDPG."

  `MPO` `policy gradient` `on-policy + off-policy`
>	"To derive our algorithm, we take advantage of the duality between control and estimation by using Expectation Maximization, a powerful tool from the probabilistic estimation toolbox, in order to solve control problems. This duality can be understood as replacing the question “what are the actions which maximise future rewards?” with the question “assuming future success in maximising rewards, what are the actions most likely to have been taken?”. By using this estimation objective we have more control over the policy change in both E and M steps yielding robust learning. We show that several algorithms, including TRPO, can be directly related to this perspective."  
>	"We leverage the fast convergence properties of EM-style coordinate ascent by alternating a non-parametric data-based E-step which re-weights state-action samples, with a supervised, parametric M-step using deep neural networks. This process is stable enough to allow us to use full covariance matrices, rather than just diagonal, in our policies."  
>	"The derivation of our algorithm starts from the classical connection between RL and probabilistic inference. Rather than estimating a single optimal trajectory methods in this space attempt to identify a distribution of plausible solutions by trading off expected return against the (relative) entropy of this distribution. Building on classical work such as Dayan & Hinton (1997) we cast policy search as a particular instance of the class of Expectation Maximization algorithms. Our algorithm then combines properties of existing approaches in this family with properties of recent off-policy algorithms for neural networks."  
>	"Specifically we propose an alternating optimization scheme that leads us to a novel, off-policy algorithm that is (a) data efficient; (b) robust and effectively hyper-parameter free; (c) applicable to complex control problems that have so far been considered outside the realm of off-policy algorithms; (d) allows for effective parallelisation."  
>	"Our algorithm separates policy learning into two alternating phases which we refer to as E and M step in reference to the EM algorithm:  
>	- E-step: In the E-step we obtain an estimate of the distribution of return-weighted trajectories. We perform this step by re-weighting state action samples using a learned value function. This is akin to posterior inference step when estimating the parameters of a probabilistic models with latent variables.  
>	- M-step: In the M-step we update the parametric policy in a supervised learning step using the reweighted state-action samples from the E-step as targets. This corresponds to the update of the model parameters given the complete data log-likelihood when performing EM for a probabilistic model."  
>	"These choices lead to the following desirable properties: (a) low-variance estimates of the expected return via function approximation; (b) low-sample complexity of value function estimate via robust off-policy learning; (c) minimal parametric assumption about the form of the trajectory distribution in the E-step; (d) policy updates via supervised learning in the M step; (e) robust updates via hard trust-region constraints in both the E and the M step."

>	"We hypothesize that a single stream of experience offers agents the opportunity to learn and perfect many policies both on purpose and incidentally, thus accelerating the acquisition of grounded knowledge. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose a deep actor-critic architecture, trained with DDPG, for learning several policies concurrently. The architecture enables the agent to attend to one task on-policy, while unintentionally learning to solve many other tasks off-policy. Importantly, the policies learned unintentionally can be harnessed for intentional use even if those policies were never followed before."  
>	"More precisely, this intentional-unintentional architecture consists of two neural networks. The actor neural network has multiple-heads representing different policies with shared lower-level representations. The critic network represents several state-action value functions, sharing a common representation for the observations."

The results for the playroom domain also showed that by increasing the number of tasks, all actors and critics learn faster.

>	"EPG unify stochastic policy gradients (SPG) and deterministic policy gradients (DPG) for reinforcement learning. Inspired by expected SARSA, EPG integrates across the action when estimating the gradient, instead of relying only on the action selected during the sampled trajectory. We establish a new general policy gradient theorem, of which the stochastic and deterministic policy gradient theorems are special cases."  
>	"We also prove that EPG reduces the variance of the gradient estimates without requiring deterministic policies and, for the Gaussian case, with no computational overhead. When the policy is Gaussian, we can now reinterpret deterministic policy gradients as an on-policy method: the deterministic policy of the original formulation is just the result of analytically integrating across actions in the Gaussian policy."  
>	"Both SPG and DPG approaches have significant shortcomings. For SPG, variance in the gradient estimates means that many trajectories are usually needed for learning. Since gathering trajectories is typically expensive, there is a great need for more sample efficient methods. DPG’s use of deterministic policies mitigates the problem of variance in the gradient but raises other difficulties. The theoretical support for DPG is limited since it assumes a critic that approximates ∇aQ when in practice it approximates Q instead. In addition, DPG learns off-policy, which is undesirable when we want learning to take the cost of exploration into account. More importantly, learning off-policy necessitates designing a suitable exploration policy, which is difficult in practice. In fact, efficient exploration in DPG is an open problem and most applications simply use independent Gaussian noise or the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck heuristic."  
>	"EPG also enables a practical contribution. Under certain conditions, we get an analytical expression for the covariance of the Gaussian that leads to a principled directed exploration strategy for continuous problems. We show that it is optimal in a certain sense to explore with a Gaussian policy such that the covariance is proportional to exp(H), where H is the scaled Hessian of the critic with respect to the actions. We present empirical results confirming that this new approach to exploration substantially outperforms DPG with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck exploration in four challenging MuJoCo domains."

  `planning` `using available environment model`
>	"The tasks that an agent will need to solve often are not known during training. However, if the agent knows which properties of the environment are important then, after learning how its actions affect those properties, it may be able to use this knowledge to solve complex tasks without training specifically for them. Towards this end, we consider a setup in which an environment is augmented with a set of user defined attributes that parameterize the features of interest. We propose a method that learns a policy for transitioning between “nearby” sets of attributes, and maintains a graph of possible transitions. Given a task at test time that can be expressed in terms of a target set of attributes, and a current state, our model infers the attributes of the current state and searches over paths through attribute space to get a high level plan, and then uses its low level policy to execute the plan. We show in 3D block stacking, gridworld games, and StarCraft that our model is able to generalize to longer, more complex tasks at test time by composing simpler learned policies."

>	"Calculating optimal plan is difficult due to the dynamics and reward functions being nonlinear, but many techniques exist for obtaining approximate solutions to finite-horizon control problems that are sufficient for succeeding at the desired task. We use a simple random-sampling shooting method in which K candidate action sequences are randomly generated, the corresponding state sequences are predicted using the learned dynamics model, the rewards for all sequences are calculated, and the candidate action sequence with the highest expected cumulative reward is chosen. Rather than have the policy execute this action sequence in open-loop, we use model predictive control: the policy executes only the first action, receives updated state information, and recalculates the optimal action sequence at the next time step. This combination of predictive dynamics model plus controller is beneficial in that the model is trained only once, but by simply changing the reward function, we can accomplish a variety of goals at run-time, without a need for live task-specific retraining."

This new family of algorithms maintains, and alternately optimizes, two policies: a fast, reactive policy (e.g., a deep neural network) deployed at test time, and a slow, non-reactive policy (e.g., Tree Search), that can plan multiple steps ahead. The reactive policy is updated under supervision from the non-reactive policy, while the non-reactive policy is improved with guidance from the reactive policy. In this work we study this Dual Policy Iteration strategy in an alternating optimization framework and provide a convergence analysis that extends existing API theory."

>	"The game of chess is the most widely-studied domain in the history of artificial intelligence. The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. In contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go, by tabula rasa reinforcement learning from games of self-play. In this paper, we generalise this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve, tabula rasa, superhuman performance in many challenging domains. Starting from random play, and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero achieved within 24 hours a superhuman level of play in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess) as well as Go, and convincingly defeated a world-champion program in each case."  
>	"no opening book, no endgame database, no heuristics, no anything"  
>	"One reason why MCTS is so effective compared to Alpha-Beta when you start to use function approximators is that neural network will inevitably have approximation errors. Alpha-Beta search is kind of minimax search and is like glorified big max operator alternating with mins, which will pick out biggest errors in function approximation and propagate it to the root of search tree. Whilst MCTS is averaging over evaluations which tends to cancel out errors in search and can be more effective because of that."  
>	"AlphaGo Zero tuned the hyper-parameter of its search by Bayesian optimization. In AlphaZero they reuse the same hyper-parameters for all games without game-specific tuning. The sole exception is the noise that is added to the prior policy to ensure exploration; this is scaled in proportion to the typical number of legal moves for that game type. Like AlphaGo Zero, the board state is encoded by spatial planes based only on the basic rules for each game. The actions are encoded by either spatial planes or a flat vector, again based only on the basic rules for each game. They applied the AlphaZero algorithm to chess, shogi, and also Go. Unless otherwise specified, the same algorithm settings, network architecture, and hyper-parameters were used for all three games."

>	"AlphaGo Zero learns two functions (which take as input the current board):  
>	- A prior over moves p is trained to predict what AlphaGo will eventually decide to do  
>	- A value function v is trained to predict which player will win (if AlphaGo plays both sides)  
>	Both are trained with supervised learning. Once we have these two functions, AlphaGo actually picks its moves by using 1600 steps of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), using p and v to guide the search. It trains p to bypass this expensive search process and directly pick good moves. As p improves, the expensive search becomes more powerful, and p chases this moving target."  
>
>	"AlphaGo Zero uses a quite different approach to deep RL than typical (model-free) algorithms such as policy gradient or Q-learning. By using AlphaGo search we massively improve the policy and self-play outcomes - and then we apply simple, gradient based updates to train the next policy + value network. This appears to be much more stable than incremental, gradient-based policy improvements that can potentially forget previous improvements."  
>	"We chose to focus more on reinforcement learning, as we believed it would ultimately take us beyond human knowledge. Our recent results actually show that a supervised-only approach can achieve a surprisingly high performance - but that reinforcement learning was absolutely key to progressing far beyond human levels."  
>
>	"AlphaGo improves the policy through REINFORCE, which is highly sample-inefficient. Then, it learns the value function for that policy. In REINFORCE one generates trajectories and then changes their probability based on the outcome of the match.  
>	AlphaGo Zero, on the other hand, changes the trajectories themselves. During self-play, an expert (MCTS) tells the policy-value network how to improve its policy-part right away. Moreover, the improved move is the one that's played, so, in the end, the outcome will be based on the improved policy. Therefore we're basically doing Generalized Policy Iteration because we're greedily improving the policy as we go and learning the value of this improved policy."  
>
>	"Differences from AlphaGo:  
>	- No human data. Learns solely by self-play reinforcement learning, starting from random.  
>	- No human features. Only takes raw board as input.  
>	- Single neural network. Policy and value networks are combined into one neural network (resnet).  
>	- Simpler search. No randomised Monte-Carlo rollouts, only uses neural network to evaluate."  
>
>	"There's a continuum between expert iteration and policy gradients. Let's say we have a two probability distributions, called policy and expert. We can write down a distance between them in two different ways. (1) KL[policy, expert] = policy * log(expert) - S[policy] (2) KL[expert, policy] = expert * log(policy) + constant. Policy gradients uses (1), and we set expert = exp(advantage estimate). AGZ uses (2) and defines expert using MCTS on the policy. The continuum between policy gradients and AGZ arises because we can vary the amount of work we put into computing the expert policy. On one extreme, policy gradient methods use a very cheap-to-compute expert: the advantage function estimate. On the other extreme, AGZ uses a very expensive-to-compute expert (via MCTS), which is much better than the current policy. Another dimension in this expert space is the bias-variance tradeoff: whether we use a Monte-Carlo estimate of returns or a learned value function. I'm curious to know under what conditions you benefit from using a more expensive expert. Anyway, I think there are a lot of interesting experiments left to do to analyze the space of algorithms between policy gradients and expert iteration."

  `learning to guide planning` `using available environment model` `search-based policy iteration` `expert iteration` `ExIt`
>	"Planning new policies is performed by tree search, while a deep neural network generalises those plans."  
>	"Expert Iteration can be viewed as an extension of Imitation Learning methods to domains where the best known experts are unable to achieve satisfactory performance. In standard IL an apprentice is trained to imitate the behaviour of an expert. In ExIt, we extend this to an iterative learning process. Between each iteration, we perform an Expert Improvement step, where we bootstrap the (fast) apprentice policy to increase the performance of the (comparatively slow) expert."  
>	"Imitation Learning is generally appreciated to be easier than Reinforcement Learning, and this partly explains why ExIt is more successful than model-free methods like REINFORCE. Furthermore, for MCTS to recommend a move, it must be unable to find any weakness with its search. Effectively, therefore, a move played by MCTS is good against a large selection of possible opponents. In contrast, in regular self play (in which the opponent move is made by the network playing as the opposite colour), moves are recommended if they beat only this single opponent under consideration. This is, we believe, a key insight into why ExIt works well (when using MCTS as the expert) - the apprentice effectively learns to play well against many opponents."

#### ["Learning to Search with MCTSnets"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04697) Guez, Weber, Antonoglou, Simonyan, Vinyals, Wierstra, Munos, Silver
  `learning to plan` `using available environment model`
>	"Planning problems are most typically solved by tree search algorithms that simulate ahead into the future, evaluate future states, and back-up those evaluations to the root of a search tree. Among these algorithms, Monte-Carlo tree search is one of the most general, powerful and widely used. A typical implementation of MCTS uses cleverly designed rules, optimised to the particular characteristics of the domain. These rules control where the simulation traverses, what to evaluate in the states that are reached, and how to back-up those evaluations. In this paper we instead learn where, what and how to search. Our architecture, which we call an MCTSnet, incorporates simulation-based search inside a neural network, by expanding, evaluating and backing-up a vector embedding. The parameters of the network are trained end-to-end using gradient-based optimisation. When applied to small searches in the well-known planning problem Sokoban, the learned search algorithm significantly outperformed MCTS baselines."  
>	"Although we have focused on a supervised learning setup, our approach could easily be extended to a reinforcement learning setup by leveraging policy iteration with MCTS. We have focused on small searches, more similar in scale to the plans that are processed by the human brain, than to the massive-scale searches in high-performance games or planning applications. In fact, our learned search performed better than a standard MCTS with more than an order-of-magnitude more computation, suggesting that neural approaches to search may ultimately replace their handcrafted counterparts."  
>	"We present a neural network architecture that includes the same processing stages as a typical MCTS, but inside the neural network itself, as a dynamic computational graph. The key idea is to represent the internal state of the search, at each node, by a memory vector. The computation of the network proceeds forwards from the root state, just like a simulation of MCTS, using a simulation policy based on the memory vector to select the trajectory to traverse. The leaf state is then processed by an embedding network to initialize the memory vector at the leaf. The network proceeds backwards up the trajectory, updating the memory at each visited state according to a backup network that propagates from child to parent. Finally, the root memory vector is used to compute an overall prediction of value or action."  
>	"The major benefit of our planning architecture, compared to more traditional planning algorithms, is that it can be exposed to gradient-based optimisation. This allows us to replace every component of MCTS with a richer, learnable equivalent - while maintaining the desirable structural properties of MCTS such as the use of a model, iterative local computations, and structured memory. We jointly train the parameters of the evaluation network, backup network and simulation policy so as to optimise the overall predictions of the MCTS network. The majority of the network is fully differentiable, allowing for efficient training by gradient descent. Still, internal action sequences directing the control flow of the network cannot be differentiated, and learning this internal policy presents a challenging credit assignment problem. To address this, we propose a novel, generally applicable approximate scheme for credit assignment that leverages the anytime property of our computational graph, allowing us to also effectively learn this part of the search network from data."

  `learning to plan` `using available environment model` `I2A`
>	"We have shown that state-space models directly learned from raw pixel observations are good candidates for model-based RL: 1) they are powerful enough to capture complex environment dynamics, exhibiting similar accuracy to frame-auto-regressive models; 2) they allow for computationally efficient Monte-Carlo rollouts; 3) their learned dynamic state-representations are excellent features for evaluating and anticipating future outcomes compared to raw pixels. This enabled Imagination Augemented Agents to outperform strong model-free baselines on MS PACMAN."  
>	"On a conceptual level, we present (to the best of our knowledge) the first results on what we termed learning-to-query. We show learning a rollout policy by backpropagating policy gradients leads to consistent (if modest) improvements."  
>	"We address, the Imagination-Augmented Agent framework, the main challenge posed by model-based RL: training accurate, computationally efficient models on more complex domains and using them with agents. First, we consider computationally efficient state-space environment models that make predictions at a higher level of abstraction, both spatially and temporally, than at the level of raw pixel observations. Such models substantially reduce the amount of computation required to perform rollouts, as future states can be represented much more compactly. Second, in order to increase model accuracy, we examine the benefits of explicitly modeling uncertainty in the transitions between these abstract states. Finally, we explore different strategies of learning rollout policies that define the interface between agent and environment model: We consider the possibility of learning to query the internal model, for guiding the Monte-Carlo rollouts of the model towards informative outcomes."  
>	"Here, we adopted the I2A assumption of having access to a pre-trained envronment model. In future work, we plan to drop this assumption and jointly learn the model and the agent."

>	"In contrast to most existing model-based reinforcement learning and planning methods, which prescribe how a model should be used to arrive at a policy, I2As learn to interpret predictions from an imperfect learned environment model to construct implicit plans in arbitrary ways, by using predictions as additional context in deep policy networks."  
>	"I2A's policy and value functions are informed by the outputs of two separate pathways: 1) a model-free path, that tries to estimate the value and which action to take directly from the latest observation ot using a CNN; and 2) a model-based path, designed in the following way. The I2A is endowed with a pretrained, fixed environment model. At every time, conditioned on past observations and actions, it uses the model to simulate possible futures (Monte-Carlo rollouts) represented by imagnations over some horizon, under a rollout policy. It then extracts informative features from the rollout imaginations, and uses these, together with the results from the model-free path, to compute policy and value functions. It has been shown that I2As are robust to model imperfections: they learn to interpret imaginations produced from the internal models in order to inform decision making as part of standard return maximization."

>	"When an agent cannot represent a perfectly accurate model of its environment’s dynamics, model-based reinforcement learning can fail catastrophically. Planning involves composing the predictions of the model; when flawed predictions are composed, even minor errors can compound and render the model useless for planning. Hallucinated Replay trains the model to “correct” itself when it produces errors, substantially improving MBRL with flawed models. This paper theoretically analyzes this approach, illuminates settings in which it is likely to be effective or ineffective, and presents a novel error bound, showing that a model’s ability to self-correct is more tightly related to MBRL performance than one-step prediction error."  
>	"Model-free methods are generally robust to representational limitations that prevent convergence to optimal behavior. In contrast, when the model representation is insufficient to perfectly capture the environment’s dynamics (even in seemingly innocuous ways), or when the planner produces suboptimal plans, MBRL methods can fail catastrophically."  
>	"This paper presents novel error bounds that reveal the theoretical principles that underlie the empirical success of Hallucinated Replay. It presents negative results that identify settings where hallucinated training would be ineffective and identifies a case where it yields a tighter performance bound than standard training. This result allows the derivation of a novel MBRL algorithm with theoretical performance guarantees that are robust to model class limitations."

  `learning to simulate` `learning full environment model`
>	"So why is model-based RL not the standard approach? Model-based RL consists of two steps: 1) transition function estimation through supervised learning, and 2) (sample-based) planning over the learned model. Each step has a particular challenging aspect. For this work we focus on a key challenge of the first step: stochasticity in the transition dynamics. Stochasticity is an inherent property of many environments, and increases in real-world settings due to sensor noise. Transition dynamics usually combine both deterministic aspects (such as the falling trajectory of an object due to gravity) and stochastic elements (such as the behaviour of another car on the road). Our goal is to learn to jointly predict these. Note that stochasticity has many forms, both homoscedastic versus heteroscedastic, and unimodal versus multimodal. In this work we specifically focus on multimodal stochasticity, as this should theoretically pose the largest challenge."  
>	"We focus on deep generative models as they can approximate complex distributions and scale to high-dimensional domains. For model-based RL we have additional requirements, as we are ultimately interested in using the model for sample-based planning. This usually requires sampling a lot of traces, so we require models that are 1) easy to sample from, 2) ideally allow planning at an abstract level. Implicit density models, like Generative Adverserial Networks lack a clear probabilistic objective function, which was the focus of this work. Among the explicit density models, there are two categories. Change of variable formula models, like Real NVP, have the drawback that the latent space dimension must equal the observation space. Fully visible belief nets like pixelCNN, which factorize the likelihood in an auto-regressive fashion, hold state-of-the-art likelihood results. However, they have the drawback that sampling is a sequential operation (e.g. pixel-by-pixel, which is computationally expensive), and they do not allow for latent level planning either. Therefore, most suitable for model-based RL seem approximate density models, most noteworthy the Variational Auto-Encoder framework. These models can estimate stochasticity at a latent level, allow for latent planning, are easy to sample from, and have a clear probabilistic interpretation."  
>	"An important challenge is planning under uncertainty. RL initially provides correlated data from a limited part of state-space. When planning over this model, we should not extrapolate too much, nor trust our model to early with limited data. Note that ‘uncertainty’ (due to limited data) is fundamentally different from the ‘stochasticity’ (true probabilistic nature of the domain) discussed in this paper."

For exploration, having uncertainty on the stochastic functions will be useful for efficient data collection."  
>	"The optimal policy can be significantly affected by the noise present in the state transitions. This is illustrated by the drunken spider story, in which a spider has two possible paths to go home: either by crossing the bridge or by walking around the lake. In the absence of noise, the bridge option is prefered since it is shorter. However, after heavily drinking alcohol, the spider’s movements may randomly deviate left or right. Since the bridge is narrow, and spiders do not like swimming, the prefered trajectory is now to walk around the lake. The previous example shows how noise can significantly affect optimal control. For example, the optimal policy may change depending on whether the level of noise is high or low. Therefore, we expect to obtain significant improvements in model-based reinforcement learning by capturing with high accuracy any noise patterns present in the state transition data."

>	"This paper studies systematic exploration for reinforcement learning with rich observations and function approximation. We introduce a new model called contextual decision processes, that unifies and generalizes most prior settings. Our first contribution is a complexity measure, the Bellman rank, that we show enables tractable learning of near-optimal behavior in these processes and is naturally small for many well-studied reinforcement learning settings. Our second contribution is a new reinforcement learning algorithm that engages in systematic exploration to learn contextual decision processes with low Bellman rank. Our algorithm provably learns near-optimal behavior with a number of samples that is polynomial in all relevant parameters but independent of the number of unique observations. The approach uses Bellman error minimization with optimistic exploration and provides new insights into efficient exploration for reinforcement learning with function approximation."

  `approximate bayesian exploration` `posterior sampling`
>	"empirical comparison of bayesian deep networks for Thompson sampling"  
>	"We study an algorithm, which we call NeuralLinear, that is remarkably simple, and combines two classic ideas (NNs and Bayesian linear regression). In our evaluation, NeuralLinear performs well across datasets. Our insight is that, once the learned representation is of decent quality, being able to exactly compute the posterior in closed form with something as simple as a linear model already leads to better decisions than most of the other methods. NeuralLinear is based on a standard deep neural network. However, decisions are made according to a Bayesian linear regression applied to the features at the last layer of the network. Note that the last hidden layer representation determines the final output of the network via a linear function, so we can expect a representation that explains the expected value of an action with a linear model. For all the training contexts, their deep representation is computed, and then uncertainty estimates on linear parameters for each action are derived via standard formulas. Thompson sampling will sample from this distribution, say \beta_t,i at time t for action i, and the next context will be pushed through the network until the last layer, leading to its representation c_t. Then, the sampled beta’s will predict an expected value, and the action with the highest prediction will be taken. Importantly, the algorithm does not use any uncertainty estimates on the representation itself (as opposed to variational methods, for example). On the other hand, the way the algorithm handles uncertainty conditional on the representation and the linear assumption is exact, which seems to be key to its success."  
>	"Variational approaches to estimate uncertainty in neural networks are an active area of research, however, there is no study that systematically benchmarks variational approaches in decision-making scenarios. We find that Bayes by Backprop underperforms even with a linear model. We demonstrate that because the method is simultaneously learning the representation and the uncertainty level. When faced with a limited optimization budget (for online learning), slow convergence becomes a serious concern. In particular, when the fitted model is linear, we evaluate the performance of a mean field model which we can solve in closed form for the variational objective. We find that as we increase number of training iterations for BBB, it slowly converges to the performance of this exact method. This is not a problem in the supervised learning setting, where we can train until convergence. Unfortunately, in the online learning setting, this is problematic, as we cannot train for an unreasonable number of iterations at each step, so poor uncertainty estimates lead to bad decisions. Additionally, tricks to speed up convergence of BBB, such as initializing the variance parameters to a small value, distort uncertainty estimates and thus are not applicable in the online decision making setting. We believe that these insights into the problems with variational approaches are of value to the community, and highlight the need for new ways to estimate uncertainty for online scenarios (i.e., without requiring great computational power)."  
>	"An interesting observation is that in many cases the stochasticity induced by stochastic gradient descent is enough to perform an implicit Thompson sampling. The greedy approach sometimes suffices (or conversely is equally bad as approximate inference). However, we also proposed the wheel problem, where the need for exploration is smoothly parameterized. In this case, we see that all greedy approaches fail."

This bound can be much tighter than traditional count-based bonuses that compound standard deviation rather than variance. Importantly, and unlike several existing approaches to optimism, this method scales naturally to large systems with complex generalization."

We also present a series of simple experiments designed to extend this intuition to deep learning. We show that many of the most popular approaches for uncertainty estimation in deep RL do not pass these sanity checks, and crystallize these shortcomings in a series of lemmas and small examples.

These methods maintain a density over the state-action space of pseudo-counts, which represent the quantity of data gathered that is relevant to each state-action pair. Such algorithms may offer a viable approach to deep exploration with generalization. There are, however, some potential drawbacks. One is that a separate representation is required to generalize counts, and it's not clear how to design an effective approach to this. As opposed to the optimal value function, which is fixed by the environment, counts are generated by the agent’s choices, so there is no single target function to learn. Second, the count model generates reward bonuses that distort data used to fit the value function, so the value function representation needs to be designed to not only capture properties of the true optimal value function but also such distorted versions. Finally, these approaches treat uncertainties as uncoupled across state-action pairs, and this can incur a substantial negative impact on statistical efficiency."

earning (Schmidhuber, 1991; 2010; Bellemare et al., 2016; Houthooft et al., 2016). The empowerment objective differs from this in a fundamental manner: the primary goal is not to understand or predict the observa
tions but to control the environment. This is an important point – agents can often control an environment perfectly well without much understanding, as exemplified by canonical model-free reinforcement learning 
algorithms (Sutton & Barto, 1998), where agents only model action-conditioned expected returns. Focusing on such understanding might significantly distract and impair the agent, as such reducing the control it ac
hieves."

>	"Authors extend existing approach by compensating the heterostacity drive encouraged by the curiosity reward with an additional homeostatic drive. The first component implements the heterostatic motivation (same as in Pathak et al 17). It refers to the tendency to push away agent from its habitual state. The second component implements the homeostatic motivation. It encourages taking actions at that lead to future states st+1 where the corresponding future action at+1 gives additional information about st+1."

In VIME, a backwards pass through the dynamics model must be computed for every transition tuple separately to compute the intrinsic rewards, whereas our surprisal bonus only requires forward passes through the dynamics model for intrinsic reward computation. Furthermore, our dynamics model is substantially simpler than the Bayesian neural network dynamics model of VIME. In our speed test, our bonus had a per-iteration speedup of a factor of 3 over VIME."

>	"Higher levels in the hierarchy can directly make use of the latent space of the lower levels as their action space, which allows to train the entire hierarchy in a layerwise fashion. This approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning has a number of conceptual and practical benefits. First, each layer in the hierarchy can be trained with exactly the same algorithm. Second, by using an invertible mapping from latent variables to actions, each layer becomes invertible, which means that the higher layer can always perfectly invert any behavior of the lower layer. This makes it possible to train lower layers on heuristic shaping rewards, while higher layers can still optimize task-specific rewards with good asymptotic performance. Finally, our method has a natural interpretation as an iterative procedure for constructing graphical models that gradually simplify the task dynamics."

  `ComposeNet`
>	"A major distinction between our work and recent attempts to learn an optimal sequence of subgoals is that our framework can learn a much richer set of compositions of skills. Our main contribution in this work is the expression of these compositions as differentiable functions. Representations of the individual skill policies are fed to this function as inputs and a representation for the composed task policy is produced. Skill policies are learned only once, and a wide variety of compositions can be created after the fact. We show that learning to compose skills is more efficient than learning to sequence those skills as is typically done in hierarchical RL. Moreover, we show how recursive compositions can be used to create rich hierarchies for more complicated behavior."  
>	"For example, in the game of Pacman, an agent must learn to collect food pellets while also avoiding enemy ghosts. In the usual view of hierarchical RL, a subgoal or option, such as "navigate to food pellet A" or "evade enemy ghost", would be activated one at a time and the agent must learn to alternate between them to complete the overall task. A better approach is to learn a policy that composes both subgoals, i.e. identifies food pellets that also keep Pacman far away from ghosts and prioritizes their collection."  
>	"In this work, we consider a subset of compositions defined by Linear Temporal Logic. A wide variety of common RL tasks can be specified using the temporal modal operators defined in LTL: next (O), always (□ ), eventually (♦ ), and until (U), along with the basic logic connectives: negation (¬), disjunction (∨ ), conjunction (∧ ) and implication (→ ). The Pacman task above can be translated into LTL as ¬G U (♦ F1 ∧ ♦ F2 ∧ ... ♦ Fn), where G is the proposition that the Pacman occupies the same location as any of the ghosts and F1 through Fn are the corresponding propositions for all the food pellets. Thus, the LTL sentence can be interpreted as “do not get eaten by a ghost until all the food pellets have been collected”."  
>	"We consider four types of compositions in Pacman task:  
>	1. ¬p U q, collect object q while evading enemy p  
>	2. ♦ p ∨ ♦ q, collect object p or q  
>	3. □ ¬p ∧ □ ¬q, always evade enemy p and enemy q

#### ["Learning with Options that Terminate Off-Policy"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03817) Harutyunyan, Vrancx, Bacon, Precup, Nowe
>	"Generally, learning with longer options (like learning with multi-step returns) is known to be more efficient. However, if the option set for the task is not ideal, and cannot express the primitive optimal policy exactly, shorter options offer more flexibility and can yield a better solution. Thus, the termination condition puts learning efficiency at odds with solution quality. We propose to resolve this dilemma by decoupling the behavior and target terminations, just like it is done with policies in off-policy learning. To this end, we give a new algorithm, Q(beta), that learns the solution with respect to any termination condition, regardless of how the options actually terminate. We derive Q(beta) by casting learning with options into a common framework with well-studied multi-step off-policy learning."

>	"Tasks that require many sequential decisions or complex solutions are hard to solve using conventional reinforcement learning algorithms. Based on the semi Markov decision process setting (SMDP) and the option framework, we propose a model which aims to alleviate these concerns. Instead of learning a single monolithic policy, the agent learns a set of simpler sub-policies as well as the initiation and termination probabilities for each of those sub-policies. While existing option learning algorithms frequently require manual specification of components such as the sub-policies, we present an algorithm which infers all relevant components of the option framework from data."

  `semantic representation`
>	"Contemporary DRL systems require very large datasets to work effectively, entailing that they are slow to learn even when such datasets are available. Moreover, they lack the ability to reason on an abstract level, which makes it difficult to implement high-level cognitive functions such as transfer learning, analogical reasoning, and hypothesis-based reasoning. Finally, their operation is largely opaque to humans, rendering them unsuitable for domains in which verifiability is important. We propose an end-to-end RL architecture comprising a neural back end and a symbolic front end with the potential to overcome each of these shortcomings."  
>	"Resulting system learns effectively and, by acquiring a set of symbolic rules that are easily comprehensible to humans, dramatically outperforms a conventional, fully neural DRL system on a stochastic variant of the game."  
>	"We tested the transfer learning capabilities of our algorithm by training an agent only on games of the grid variant then testing it on games of the random variant. After training, the unsupervised neural back end of the system is able to form a symbolic representation of any given frame within the micro-world of the game. In effect it has acquired the ontology of that micro-world, and this capability can be applied to any game within that micro-world irrespective of its specific rules. In the present case, no re-training of the back end was required when the system was applied to new variants of the game."

  `simulation to real world`
>	"While sample complexity can be reduced by training policies in simulation, such policies can perform sub-optimally on the real platform given imperfect calibration of model dynamics. We present an approach -- supplemental to fine tuning on the real robot -- to further benefit from parallel access to a simulator during training and reduce sample requirements on the real robot. The developed approach harnesses auxiliary rewards to guide the exploration for the real world agent based on the proficiency of the agent in simulation and vice versa. In this context, we demonstrate empirically that the reciprocal alignment for both agents provides further benefit as the agent in simulation can adjust to optimize its behaviour for states commonly visited by the real-world agent."  
>	"We propose MATL, which instead of directly adapting the simulation policy, guides the exploration for both systems towards mutually aligned state distributions via auxiliary rewards. The method employs an adversarial approach to train policies with additional rewards based on confusing a discriminator with respect to the originating system for state sequences visited by the agents. By guiding the target agent on the robot towards states that the potentially more proficient source agent visits in simulation, we can accelerate training. In addition to aligning the robot policy to adapt to progress in simulation, we extend the approach to mutually align both systems which can be beneficial as the agent in simulation will be driven to explore better trajectories from states visited by the real-world policy."  
>	"We demonstrate that auxiliary rewards, which guide the exploration on the target platform, improve performance in environments with sparse rewards and can even guide the agent if only uninformative or no environment rewards at all are given for the target agent."

#### ["Kickstarting Deep Reinforcement Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03835) Schmitt et al.
  `policy distillation`
>	"The idea of having experts which can be used to train new agents through matching the output distributions was adapted for multitask reinforcement learning. Typically one gathers experience from expert policies, which are then used to train a student model using supervised learning. Consequently the focus has hitherto been on compression and teacher-matching, rather than the ultimate goal of reward maximisation. Although it is not explored in these papers, after performing distillation one could fine-tune the student policy using rewards. Kickstarting can be seen as a continuous version of such two-phase learning, with a focus on reward maximisation from the very beginning (which does not require arbitrary stopping criteria for any of the phases, as it is a joint optimisation problem)."  
>	"The main idea is to employ an auxiliary loss function which encourages the student policy to be close to the teacher policy on the trajectories sampled by the student. Importantly, the weight of this loss in the overall learning objective is allowed to change over time, so that the student can gradually focus more on maximising rewards it receives from the environment, potentially surpassing the teacher (which might indeed have an architecture with less learning capacity). In multi-task problems, it is also straightforward to extend this approach to the case of multiple teachers, each of which is an expert on a particular task: in this case the student will learn from an appropriate teacher on each task using an analogous formulation."  
>	"Our auxiliary loss can also be seen from the perspective of entropy regularisation. In the A3C method one adds the negated entropy H(πS(a|xt,ω)) as an auxiliary loss to encourage exploration. But minimisation of negated entropy is equivalent to minimising the KL divergence DKL(πS(a|xt,ω),U), where U is a uniform distribution over actions. Similarly the kickstarter loss is equivalent to the KL divergence between the teacher and the student policies. In this sense, the kickstarter loss can be seen as encouraging behaviour similar to the teacher, but just as entropy regularisation is not supposed to lead to convergence to a uniform policy, the goal of kickstarting is not to converge to the teacher’s policy. The aim of both is to provide a helpful auxiliary loss, based on what is a sensible behaviour – for the case of entropy regularization it is just sampling a random action, while for kickstarting it is following the teacher."

  `policy distillation`
>	"The assumption is that the tasks are related to each other (e.g. being in the same environment or having the same physics) and so good action sequences tend to recur across tasks. Our method achieves this by simultaneously distilling task-specific policies into a common default policy, and transferring this common knowledge across tasks by regularising all task-specific policies towards the default policy."  
>	"We observe that distillation arises naturally as one half of an optimization procedure when using KL divergences to regularize the output of task models towards a distilled model. The other half corresponds to using the distilled model as a regularizer for training the task models."  
>	"Another observation is that parameters in deep networks do not typically by themselves have any semantic meaning, so instead of regularizing networks in parameter space, it is worthwhile considering regularizing networks in a more semantically meaningful space, e.g. of policies."

  `policy distillation`
>	"It is often quite practical to provide the agent with reward functions in a limited set of situations, such as when a human supervisor is present or in a controlled setting. Can we make use of this limited supervision, and still benefit from the breadth of experience an agent might collect on its own? We formalize this problem as semisupervised reinforcement learning, where the reward function can only be evaluated in a set of "labeled" MDPs, and the agent must generalize its behavior to the wide range of states it might encounter in a set of "unlabeled" MDPs, by using experience from both settings. Our proposed method infers the task objective in the unlabeled MDPs through an algorithm that resembles inverse RL, using the agent's own prior experience in the labeled MDPs as a kind of demonstration of optimal behavior. We evaluate our method on challenging tasks that require control directly from images, and show that our approach can improve the generalization of a learned deep neural network policy by using experience for which no reward function is available. We also show that our method outperforms direct supervised learning of the reward."

  `successor features`
>	"Extension to SF&GPI (Successor Features + Generalized Policy Improvement) framework in two ways."  
>	"First, its applicability is broader than initially shown. SF&GPI was designed for the scenario where each task corresponds to a different reward function; one of the basic assumptions in the original formulation was that the rewards of all tasks can be computed as a linear combination of a fixed set of features. Such an assumption is not strictly necessary, and in fact it is possible to have guarantees on the performance of the transferred policy even on tasks that are not in the span of the features. The realisation above adds some flexibility to the problem of computing features that are useful for transfer."  
>	"Second, by looking at the associated approximation from a slightly different angle, we show that one can replace the features with actual rewards. This makes it possible to apply SF&GPI online at scale."  
>	"We show that the transfer promoted by SF&GPI leads to good policies on unseen tasks almost instantaneously. Furthermore, we show how to learn policies that are specialised to the new tasks in a way that allows them to be added to the agent’s ever-growing set of skills, a crucial ability for continual learning."

  `imitation learning from visual observations`
>	"Standard imitation learning methods assume that the agent receives examples of observation-action tuples that could be provided, for instance, to a supervised learning algorithm. This stands in contrast to how humans and animals imitate: we observe another person performing some behavior and then figure out which actions will realize that behavior, compensating for changes in viewpoint, surroundings, and embodiment. We term this kind of imitation learning as imitation-from-observation and propose an imitation learning method based on video prediction with context translation and deep reinforcement learning. This lifts the assumption in imitation learning that the demonstration should consist of observations and actions in the same environment, and enables a variety of interesting applications, including learning robotic skills that involve tool use simply by observing videos of human tool use."

>	"Learning a policy from third-person experience is different from standard imitation learning which assumes the same "viewpoint" for teacher and student. The authors build upon Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning, which uses a GAN framework to discriminate between teacher and student experience and force the student to behave close to the teacher. However, when using third-person experience from a different viewpoint the discriminator would simply learn to discriminate between viewpoints instead of behavior and the framework isn't easily applicable. The authors' solution is to add a second discriminator to maximize a domain confusion loss based on the same feature representation. The objective is to learn the same (viewpoint-independent) feature representation for both teacher and student experience while also learning to discriminate between teacher and student observations. In other words, the objective is to maximize domain confusion while minimizing class loss."

>	"Imitation learning has traditionally been applied to learn a single task from demonstrations thereof. The requirement of structured and isolated demonstrations limits the scalability of imitation learning approaches as they are difficult to apply to real-world scenarios, where robots have to be able to execute a multitude of tasks. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal imitation learning framework that is able to segment and imitate skills from unlabelled and unstructured demonstrations by learning skill segmentation and imitation learning jointly."

We demonstrate that our method may be used to discover the hierarchical structure of a task similarly to the hierarchical reinforcement learning approaches."

### reinforcement learning - multi-agent

----
#### ["A Unified Game-Theoretic Approach to Multiagent Reinforcement Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00832) Lanctot, Zambaldi, Gruslys, Lazaridou, Tuyls, Perolat, Silver, Graepel
>	"We first observe that independent reinforcement learners produce policies that can be jointly correlated, failing to generalize well during execution with other agents. We quantify this effect by proposing a new metric called joint policy correlation. We then propose an algorithm motivated by game-theoretic foundations, which generalises several previous approaches such as fictitious play, iterated best response, independent RL, and double oracle. We show that our algorithm can reduce joint policy correlation significantly in first-person coordination games, and finds robust counter-strategies in a common poker benchmark game."  

#### ["Learning Nash Equilibrium for General-Sum Markov Games from Batch Data"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08718) Perolat, Strub, Piot, Pietquin
>	"We address the problem of learning a Nash equilibrium in γ-discounted multiplayer general-sum Markov Games in a batch setting. As the number of players increases in MG, the agents may either collaborate or team apart to increase their final rewards. One solution to address this problem is to look for a Nash equilibrium. Although, several techniques were found for the subcase of two-player zero-sum MGs, those techniques fail to find a Nash equilibrium in general-sum Markov Games."  
>	"We introduce a new (weaker) definition of ε-Nash equilibrium in MGs which grasps the strategy’s quality for multiplayer games. We prove that minimizing the norm of two Bellman-like residuals implies to learn such an ε-Nash equilibrium. Then, we show that minimizing an empirical estimate of the Lp norm of these Bellman-like residuals allows learning for general-sum games within the batch setting. Finally, we introduce a neural network architecture that successfully learns a Nash equilibrium in generic multiplayer general-sum turn-based MGs."

  `QMIX`
>	"Learning joint action-values conditioned on extra state information is an attractive way to exploit centralised learning, where global state information is available and communication constraints are lifted, but the best strategy for then extracting decentralised policies is unclear. QMIX trains decentralised policies in a centralised end-to-end fashion. QMIX employs a network that estimates joint action-values as a complex non-linear combination of per-agent values that condition only on local observations. QMIX structurally enforces that the joint-action value is monotonic in the per-agent values, which allows tractable maximisation of the joint action-value in off-policy learning, and guarantees consistency between the centralised and decentralised policies."

>	"One of the great challenges when training multi-agent policies is the credit assignment problem. Just like in a football team, the reward achieved depends on the actions of all of the different agents. Given that all agents are constantly improving their policies, it is difficult for any given agent to evaluate the impact of their individual action on the overall performance of the team."  
>	"We evaluate COMA in the testbed of StarCraft unit micromanagement, using a decentralised variant with significant partial observability. COMA significantly improves average performance over other multi-agent actor-critic methods in this setting, and the best performing agents are competitive with state-of-the-art centralised controllers that get access to the full state."  
>	"COMA uses a centralised critic to train decentralised actors, estimating a counterfactual advantage function for each agent in order to address multi-agent credit assignment. COMA learns a fully centralised state-action value function and then uses it to guide the optimisation of decentralised policies in an actor-critic framework. This requires on-policy learning, which can be sample-inefficient, and training the fully centralised critic becomes impractical when there are more than a handful of agents."

>	"Using the DSL grammar and reinforcement learning to improve synthesis of programs with complex control flow."  
>	"Sequence-to-sequence generation models are trained to maximize the likelihood of known reference programs. This strategy has two key limitations. First, it ignores Program Aliasing: the fact that many different programs may satisfy a given specification (especially with incomplete specifications such as a few input-output examples). By maximizing the likelihood of only a single reference program, it penalizes many semantically correct programs, which can adversely affect the synthesizer performance. Second, this strategy overlooks the fact that programs have a strict syntax that can be efficiently checked."

It learns explicit programs from examples that are readable, interpretable, and verifiable. ∂ILP is given a partial set of examples (the desired results) and produces a program that satisfies them. It searches through the space of programs using gradient descent. If the outputs of the program conflict with the desired outputs from the reference data, the system revises the program to better match the data."

#### ["Learning to Select Examples for Program Synthesis"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03243) Pu, Miranda, Solar-Lezama, Kaelbling
>	"Due to its precise and combinatorial nature, program synthesis is commonly formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem, where input-output examples are encoded as constraints and solved with a constraint solver. A key challenge of this formulation is scalability: while constraint solvers work well with few well-chosen examples, a large set of examples can incur significant overhead in both time and memory. We address this challenge by constructing a representative subset of examples that is both small and able to constrain the solver sufficiently. We build the subset one example at a time, using a neural network to predict the probability of unchosen input-output examples conditioned on the chosen input-output examples, and adding the least probable example to the subset."

#### ["Learning Neural Programs To Parse Programs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01284) Chen, Liu, Song
>	"We explore a new direction to learn domain-specific programs significantly more complex than previously considered in the literature of learning programs from input-output examples only. In particular, we consider an exemplary problem to learn a program to parse an input satisfying a context-free grammar into its abstract syntax tree. This problem is challenging when the underlying grammar is unknown, and only input-output examples are provided. The program to be synthesized in this problem, i.e., a parser, is more complex than programs consisting of string operations as in many previous work, and thus serves as a good next step challenge to tackle in the domain of learning programs from input-output examples."  
>	"Recent works propose to use sequence-to-sequence models to directly generate parse trees from inputs. However, they often do not generalize well, and our experiments show that their test accuracy is almost 0% on inputs longer than those seen in training."  
>	"This work is the first successful demonstration that reinforcement learning can be applied to train a neural program operating a non-differentiable machine with input-output pairs only, while the learned neural program can fully generalize to longer inputs on a non-trivial task."  
>	"To show that our approach is general and can learn to parse different types of context-free languages using the same architecture and approach, we evaluate it on learning the parsing programs for an imperative language and a functional one, and demonstrate that our approach can successfully learn both of them, and the learned programs can achieve 100% on test set whose inputs are 100x longer than training samples."  
>	"We propose a new approach to learn a hybrid program, a differentiable neural program operating a domain-specific non-differentiable machine, from input-output examples only. Learning such a hybrid program combines the advantage of both differentiable and non-differentiable machines to enable learning more complex programs."  
>	"First, we propose LL machines as an example domain-specific non-differentiable machine to be operated by neural programs, for learning parsers. Intuitively, an LL machine provides a high-level abstraction to regularize the learned programs to be within the space of LL(1) parsers. The instructions provided by an LL machine provide richer semantic information than the primitives considered in previous works, so that the learning algorithm can take advantage of such information to learn more complex programs."  
>	"Second, we propose novel reinforcement learning-based techniques to train a neural program. Specifically, we solve the training problem in two phases: (1) we search for a valid execution trace set for each input-output example; then (2) we search for a set of input-output-trace combinations, so that a neural program can be trained to fit all training examples."

Note that the MCTS probabilities of move in AlphaZero is constructed from the visit counts of all the edges connected to the MCTS root node, meaning that it only uses information near the root node to improve the policy network.

>	"Learning from few examples and generalizing to dramatically different situations are capabilities of human visual intelligence that are yet to be matched by leading machine learning models. By drawing inspiration from systems neuroscience, we introduce a probabilistic generative model for vision in which message-passing based inference handles recognition, segmentation and reasoning in a unified way. The model demonstrates excellent generalization and occlusion-reasoning capabilities, and outperforms deep neural networks on a challenging scene text recognition benchmark while being 300-fold more data efficient. In addition, the model fundamentally breaks the defense of modern text-based CAPTCHAs by generatively segmenting characters without CAPTCHA-specific heuristics. Our model emphasizes aspects like data efficiency and compositionality that may be important in the path toward general artificial intelligence."

We apply it to solving Sudoku puzzles and achieve state-of-the-art results solving 96.6% of the hardest Sudoku puzzles. For comparison the relational network fails to solve any puzzles. We also apply our model to the BaBi textual QA dataset solving 19/20 tasks which is competitive with state- of-the-art sparse differentiable neural computers. The recurrent relational network is a general purpose module that can be added to any neural network model to add a powerful relational reasoning capacity."  
>	"Both relational networks, interaction networks and our proposed model can be seen as an instance of Graph Neural Networks. Our main contribution is showing how these can be used for complex relational reasoning."  
>	"Our model can be seen as a completely learned message passing algorithm. Belief propagation is a hand-crafted message passing algorithm for performing exact inference in directed acyclic graphical models. If the graph has cycles, one can use a variant, loopy belief propagation, but it is not guaranteed to be exact, unbiased or even converge. Empirically it works well though and it is widely used."  
>	"There are plenty of algorithms out there for solving Sudokus. The RRN differs from these traditional algorithms in two important ways:

It also enables the CNN to properly localize question-referenced objects."

>	"Using standard neural encoder–decoder components to build models for representation and search in this space, we demonstrated that our approach outperforms strong baselines on classification, structured prediction and reinforcement learning tasks."  
>	"The approach outperforms both multi-task and meta-learning approaches that map directly from training examples to outputs by way of a real-valued parameterization, as well as approaches that make use of natural language annotations as an additional supervisory signal rather than an explicit latent parameter. The natural language concept descriptions inferred by our approach often agree with human annotations when they are correct, and provide an interpretable debugging signal when incorrect. In short, by equipping models with the ability to “think out loud” when learning, they become both more comprehensible and more accurate."  
>	"- Language encourages compositional generalization: standard deep learning architectures are good at recognizing new instances of previously encountered concepts, but not always at generalizing to new ones. By forcing decisions to pass through a linguistic bottleneck in which the underlying compositional structure of concepts is explicitly expressed, stronger generalization becomes possible.  
>	- Language simplifies structured exploration: relatedly, linguistic scaffolding can provide dramatic advantages in problems like reinforcement learning that require exploration: models with latent linguistic parameterizations can sample in this space, and thus limit exploration to a class of behaviors that are likely a priori to be goal-directed and interpretable.  
>	- Language can help learning: in multitask settings, it can even improve learning on tasks for which no language data is available at training or test time. While some of these advantages are also provided by techniques like program synthesis that are built on top of formal languages, natural language is at once more expressive and easier to obtain than formal supervision."

  `goal-driven language learning`
>	"The agent learns simple language by making predictions about the world in which that language occurs, and by discovering which combinations of words, perceptual cues and action decisions result in positive outcomes. Its knowledge is distributed across language, vision and policy networks, and pertains to modifiers, relational concepts and actions, as well as concrete objects. Its semantic representations enable the agent to productively interpret novel word combinations, to apply known relations and modifiers to unfamiliar objects and to re-use knowledge pertinent to the concepts it already has in the process of acquiring new concepts."  
>	"While our simulations focus on language, the outcomes are relevant to machine learning in a more general sense. In particular, the agent exhibits active, multi-modal concept induction, the ability to transfer its learning and apply its knowledge representations in unfamiliar settings, a facility for learning multiple, distinct tasks, and the effective synthesis of unsupervised and reinforcement learning. At the same time, learning in the agent reflects various effects that are characteristic of human development, such as rapidly accelerating rates of vocabulary growth, the ability to learn from both rewarded interactions and predictions about the world, a natural tendency to generalise and re-use semantic knowledge, and improved outcomes when learning is moderated by curricula."

>	"Though the agents come up with words that we found to correspond to objects and other agents, as well as actions like 'Look at' or 'Go to', to the agents these words are abstract symbols represented by one-hot vector - we label these one-hot vectors with English words that capture their meaning for the sake of interpretability."  
>
>	"One possible scenario is from goal oriented-dialog systems. Where one agent tries to transmit to another certain API call that it should perform (book restaurant, hotel, whatever). I think these models can make it more data efficient. At the first stage two agents have to communicate and discover their own language, then you can add regularization to make the language look more like natural language and on the final stage, you are adding a small amount of real data (dialog examples specific for your task). I bet that using additional communication loss will make the model more data efficient."  
>
>	"The big outcome to hunt for in this space is a post-gradient descent learning algorithm. Of course you can make agents that play the symbol grounding game, but it's not a very big step from there to compression of data, and from there to compression of 'what you need to know to solve the problem you're about to encounter' - at which point you have a system which can learn by training or learn by receiving messages. It was pretty easy to get stuff like one agent learning a classifier, encoding it in a message, and transmitting it to a second agent who has to use it for zero-shot classification. But it's still single-task specific communication, so there's no benefit to the agent for receiving, say, the messages associated with the previous 100 tasks. The tricky thing is going from there to something more abstract and cumulative, so that you can actually use message generation as an iterative learning mechanism. I think a large part of that difficulty is actually designing the task ensemble, not just the network architecture."

First, in a two-player game, a discriminator is trained to distinguish between the mapped source embeddings and the target embeddings, while the mapping (which can be seen as a generator) is jointly trained to fool the discriminator. Second, we extract a synthetic dictionary from the resulting shared embedding space and fine-tune the mapping with the closed-form Procrustes solution."

Each dot represents a word in that space. The size of the dot is proportional to the frequency of the words in the training corpus of that language.  
>	Using adversarial learning, we learn a rotation matrix W which roughly aligns the two distributions. The green stars are randomly selected words that are fed to the discriminator to determine whether the two word embeddings come from the same distribution.

>	Finally, we translate by using the mapping W and a distance metric, dubbed CSLS, that expands the space where there is high density of points (like the area around the word “cat”), so that “hubs” (like the word “cat”) become less close to other word vectors than they would otherwise (compare to the same region in panel (A))."

  `topic modeling`
>	"Traditional inference methods have sought closed-form derivations for updating the models, however as the expressiveness of these models grows, so does the difficulty of performing fast and accurate inference over their parameters. This paper presents alternative neural approaches to topic modelling by providing parameterisable distributions over topics which permit training by backpropagation in the framework of neural variational inference. In addition, with the help of a stick-breaking construction, we propose a recurrent network that is able to discover a notionally unbounded number of topics, analogous to Bayesian non-parametric topic models."

  `semantic parsing`
>	"We learn a semantic parser for an academic domain from scratch by deploying an online system using our interactive learning algorithm. After three train-deploy cycles, the system correctly answered 63.51% of user’s questions. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to learn a semantic parser using a live system, and is enabled by our models that can directly parse language to SQL without manual intervention."

  `dependency parsing` `SyntaxNet` `Parsey McParseface`
>	"The parser uses a feed forward NN, which is much faster than the RNN usually used for parsing. Also the paper is using a global method to solve the label bias problem. This method can be used for many tasks and indeed in the paper it is used also to shorten sentences by throwing unnecessary words. The label bias problem arises when predicting each label in a sequence using a softmax over all possible label values in each step. This is a local approach but what we are really interested in is a global approach in which the sequence of all labels that appeared in a training example are normalized by all possible sequences. This is intractable so instead a beam search is performed to generate alternative sequences to the training sequence. The search is stopped when the training sequence drops from the beam or ends. The different beams with the training sequence are then used to compute the global loss."

#### ["On the Use of Word Embeddings Alone to Represent Natural Language Sequences"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy5OAyZC-) Shen et al.
>	"To construct representations for natural language sequences, information from two main sources needs to be captured: (i) semantic meaning of individual words, and (ii) their compositionality. These two types of information are usually represented in the form of word embeddings and compositional functions, respectively. For the latter, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been considered. There has not been a rigorous evaluation regarding the relative importance of each component to different text-representation-based tasks; i.e., how important is the modeling capacity of word embeddings alone, relative to the added value of a compositional function? We conduct an extensive comparative study between Simple Word Embeddings-based Models (SWEMs), with no compositional parameters, relative to employing word embeddings within RNN/CNN-based models. Surprisingly, SWEMs exhibit comparable or even superior performance in the majority of cases considered."

  `language modeling`
>	"We propose an extension of continuous cache models, which can scale to larger contexts. We use a large scale non-parametric memory component that stores all the hidden activations seen in the past. We leverage recent advances in approximate nearest neighbor search and quantization algorithms to store millions of representations while searching them efficiently."
